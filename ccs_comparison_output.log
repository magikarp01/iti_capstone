Example: [Fantasy and Science Fiction; What's better!?] This is one of Anthony's more serious works when compared to the Xanth puns. The book--the series in fact--has the essence of both Sci-Fi AND Fantasy blended together in a cohesive work that should delight both the AD&D players and the Trekkers
Example: [A little too convenient] This was my first Jo Beverly novel and it wasn't bad. I liked the heroine Susan, she made mistakes, but didn't consider herself a tragic heroine. Con was okay. A little dense. Where I had problems were some of the "twists" in the plot. I thought they were a little too tidy. I also thought the inclusion of the Georges and the Rogues were unnecessary at the end. Like I said, not a bad book, but not really a keeper either.
Example: [Too complex and not very fun] After 90 minutes of play and no sight of an end we gave up. Got old very fast. I am a huge Jeff Foxworthy fan but this game was way to complex for a redneck like me.. Don't waste your money on this one.
Example: [Darth Vader still #1!] No way in the world can I believe that Xixor is as smart and cunning as Darth or Jabba. There was not enough space action or blaster showdowns as it should have. Dash Rander was okay... Xixor and Guri just plain sucked. Mr. Perry took way to many chances throughout the book to build them up for nothing. I hope they both died and never come back. As far as Darth Vader's equal, PLEASE. Not on even. Vader has been around for decades, and all of a sudden I'm supposed to think Xixor is just as ruthless? Nope. I was tricked by the bestseller thing at the top of the book. No more.
Example: [Shoddy Customer Service] I can't review this product fully because it was missing parts when it arrived. So I have not been able to fully assemble the unit. I called Valley's customer service department and the person on the phone seemed sure that all the parts were there and that I just didn't know what I was talking about. After going back and forth for fifteen minutes he finally agreed that a part was missing and took down my information. It has been one month to the day that I placed the order and I still have not received the part. I've made numerous attempts to call them by phone and I get voicemail every time. I also sent an email that has not been answered either.
Example: [Breathtaking!! A powerful story of love and betrayal] I couldn't put this one down. This is the first time I've read Teresa Medeiros,and it won't be the last!!Ms Medeiros takes you deep into the story with her captivating use of words. You feel every emotion the characters go through. This story left me breathless.
Example: [Testament] I am grateful for the witness that believing Christians can obtain and strengthen from this additional Testament of Jesus Christ.Nephi, Alma, Mormon and Moroni all become new witnesses along side Peter, Paul and John. The additional account of Jesus' ministry in the Americas after His resurrection is a calming, reaffirming credential to the truth of His life and mission, both mortal and immortal.
Example: [Very disappointing Jack White group work] Huge Jack White and White Stripes fan, but this has nothing worthy of discussing. Their other album would be a better choice to start with.
Example: [Stretching for Seniors] I was disappointed in this video. Although she is in very good shape for an older person I didn't feel any energy from her. I wanted more stretches, not ballet.
Example: [Memorial Day is outstanding] I've recently purchased all of Vince Flynn's previous books in paperback so I could read everything he has written in sequence. Memorial Day is another outstandingly written book in the Mitch Rapp series.
Example: [5 Years ago...] I bought this saucepan back in 2005 from amazon.com and has been using it frequently to cook all kinds of food (mainly soup and stir-fry dishes). This pan is heavy, build to last and quite versatile. I highly recommend it :) Still one of my favorite pan after all these years...
Example: [NOT a DVD] Please be aware that this is not a DVD for use in a DVD player. It is a disc made only for the "Read with Me DVD Learning System". This was not clear in the item description and my daughter was in tears when her birthday present wouldn't work. I felt really bad for her and feel mislead.
Example: [Great for casserole storage] I have had a baking dish w/lid like this for years. I got online to see if I could find another as I use it constantly. It's great for casseroles as left overs are easily stored in same dish they were cooked in. I make meatloaf up ahead of time and put them in the freezer in this dish to pull out in a week or two. I love it!I have a suggestion for the person making a cake - use smaller cake mixes or brownies - then the icing isn't tall enough to stick :)
Example: [This is not a beginner's book, I know I am a programmer.] I wasted my money on this book. It says it is a beginner book;but it is definitly not!!! Sorry, but I would like to give ita good rating, but I just can't. In the first few pages itjumps in to complexity. I read more to see if it was gettingbetter, but it got worse. I did find a good book for begginer's.They are out there. I am surprised that the preface for this saysit is for beginner's. Number 1 best seller? Maybe I should writea book then!! This book is a reference book, not a beginner's!Trust me. I could go on and on, but if you are a beginner, all I can say is do not get it.
Example: [My Book Review] This book was required for my CULA 101 class and i found it very hard to understand some of the terms used in the text. I know the book was translated from french to english, nut i feel that the book is on a level that on professionals of the highest ranking can understand. I would hate to say it, but if you "dummy down" the book, i am sure more people would be able to understand it.
Example: [Time Machine] A pleasing variety of Swing tunes that will bring you back to the 1940s in no time at all.
Example: [A good give-away] Reminds me of the stuff we used to see on Saturday afternoon back in the 40's and 50's - I gave mine away.
Example: [This book is painfully bad] Read 3/4 of the book and stopped. I don't know why the author even attempted to write this book or how it even got published. He seems to take pride in being a maverick and general goofball. The author did nail the title though. Save your money....
Example: [peace] While I was recovering from a horrible tragedy I was given this CD from a friend. I listened to it just about every hour I was awake for months. It really brought me peace and helped me to heal. I have since used it as a gift to others that are suffering.
Example: [Junk] The lid on the cup broke within 5 uses despite the cup being only half filled with grounds. Unfortunately, I cannot return it. Furthermore, this device made a horrible cup of coffee. I tried various grind consistencies but each cup was extremely weak. You could actually watch the "coffee" coming out of the Keurig clear. Lastly, this cup leaked the water/coffee all over the counter and machine. What a joke. Keurig should be ashamed.
Example: [Amazon needs a negative star rating for this...] Say what you will about whatever you consider the worst film ever made...mutiply it by about 7 and you come pretty close to this garbage. I actually bought this (used at a video store) because it was the last film appearance by James Doohan (Star Trek's Scotty). Not only was it sad to see him so far gone but for it to be in this swill is just gut-wrenching.I won't even attempt to actually review this...just stay very far away. Even the Mystery Science Theater 3000 guys wouldn't touch this one.
Example: [Good Nail/Hair Vitamins] was having a problem with nails not growing and decided to try these......have to say they work cause now after a few short months my nails (and hair) are growing like weeds!!!!
Example: [Wow, this is great] My dog loves this water dog. At first he was a little hesitant with the clicking noise this makes when it senses the dog or something else near, but I trained him to ignore the noise. Now all I say is go get water and he goes over and gets his water. When he is in the yard by himself he will go over and get water without an issue. I really like the fact that he has fresh clean water whenever he wants it and I am not filling water bowls outside all the time. Great Product!
Example: [Nice Novel] Anyone who thinks this is anything other than a book version of National Enquirer has a short-circuit in his or her B.S. detector. I'm not saying that some strange things didn't happen, but the telling of this story is just that-- a story, meant to entertain, garner attention, and make money, and I'm sure they have succeeded at all three. Please, don't be so gullible people. It's ok to be a believer, but be smart and discerning about what you believe. If you want a for-instance, read Witness to Roswell, and compare the quality of writing, research, and documentation to this garbage. That will give you a standard by which to judge.
Example: [Pathetic] As a 20 year player of Dungeons and Dragons, I have to say that this movie is one of the worst ones I've seen in my entire life. The only entertainment value in it is laughing at just how bad the acting, dialogue, and story is. ...wait for Lord of the Rings to come out this winter.
Example: [NOT as shown] Item is NOT as shown on you on-Line advertisement! There it is shown as a complete tailgate locking system including the handle not as received consisting of only the Bezel, lock and two key! I consider this fraudulent method of advertising and do expect to be credited the full amount of purchase, shipping and the additional cost of the return shipment! returned 12 days ago still waiting refund
Example: [Terrible for skiing goggles] I have eye contacts and need an airtight fit -- these will NOT provide that because the magnet is not nearly strong enough to keep the goggles fastened under decent tension.
Example: [crap] i paid [...] bucks for tyhis gun got it and got it ready and figured out how it worksand after using it a few time si relized its flawsfirst its too damn smallits accurcy is not bad but its velocity is utter crapand doenst do squat in heavy battlesand the clip is a reduiclus system of shaking the rounds form teh clips into the spring ssystembuy this for collections and maybe for soem fun but not a good gun and it jammed after the first month and i broke it trying to fix it
Example: [Perfect for falling asleep] This CD puts me to sleep -- which is a good thing. In addition to the babbling water, there are bird and other forest sounds, but nothing is too loud or jarring. I put this in my CD player, press 'repeat' and drift away. If you share a house with snorers, it's either environmental recordings like this one or earplugs!
Example: [Very disappointed] When I bought this flight simulator I was told since I had a brand new computer that was more than powerfull enough that I would really enjoy this thing. Well I guess they lied. You probably have to spend $5,000 on a computer to run this thing and get all the effects that were put into it. I can either get great graphics with a really bad flight or a great flight with practically no graphics at all but not both. When I called Microsoft, the woman I spoke to in India could barely speak English and she didn't seem to have a clue about what my problem was.
Example: [Great shredder + flimsy bucket = total disappointment] The top portion, the shredder itself, is very well designed, but the bucket is made of a flimsy plastic that is hardly able to hold the heavy top. If I could rate the parts separately, I would give 5 stars for the top and -3 points for the bucket. If it was not for the desperate desire to cut manufacturing costs [Fellowes, why not to try using a paper bucket next?], it could have been a great shredder. Unfortunately, the product overall is not worth its shipping price, not to mention the $100+ price tag.
Example: [The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle] We thoroughly enjoyed this book. It captivates you from the very beginning. This book uses great imagery and descriptive language. We felt that the book made us feel as if we were on the ship with Charlotte. Every aspect of that book reached out to us. We feel that this would be a great book to use in the classroom. The descriptive language is wonderful and would be an excellent example to use when teaching this concept. We feel that this book would be beneficial for 5-7th Grade. Once again we really enjoyed reading this book.
Example: [Misled!] Do not buy this single if you are looking for the ballad version of Alive. Silly me, I must have missed when it was clearly stated that the version here was an uptempo one when I ordered it from Amazon, and only got suspicious when the CD arrived and I looked at the back. I'm not a great fan of J-Lo's singing but I do like the ballad version of Alive. However, there is no way I will be buying the remixes CD- what was she thinking putting a ballad on that CD! I guess I will have to enjoy it on radio.
Example: [I'm Keith Ferrazzi, the most important person in the history of the universe!!] Keith Ferrazzi thinks he's SOOOO COOOLLL!!
Example: [Nice for the price] Good product, was concerned before purchase based on other reviews. I had no problem with assembly. on the first couple of uses the mounting bracket seemed to turn on the seat post but then I realized it was the seat post itself that was turning. Tightened its bolt and everything is working fine.
Example: [Escaflowne the series] The first Escaflowne I experienced was the movie (Which was great). Then I read the comic book series (And that was awesome!!!). Then I saw the series and sank.... I was expecting the same action packed storyline with twists and cool characters as the comic books. But it seems that the anime series was the prototype for the real story. Not only does the anime series and comic book series have different views on what the characters look like, but it is missing some of the great twists and events that the comic book storyline has in it. Then I realized that the comic book was made AFTER the series instead of BEFORE.I believe that the anime series not only has some of the worst animation I have ever seen, but definitaly the worst voice acting I have ever heard (English Audio).If you really want the GOOD Escaflowne experience instead of the AVERAGE one, Watch the movie then read the comic books and totally ignore the TV series. In other words, Don't waste your time watching it.
Example: [Mediocre at best.] First the good news: the actual writing isn't bad, in terms of technical competence. The characters were mostly handled well, both in terms of dialogue and interaction; Major Kira was a bit too hostile, but that was fairly standard for this early in the series, and Odo displayed a variety of intelligence that I don't expect to see from him, but otherwise the book was well enough written to make two separate fairly uninteresting plots passably readable.But that's the bad news: the story behind the writing just wasn't interesting; it's a bad sign when the poker tournament at Quark's is more interesting than the obligatory station crisis.This book was actually written as a collaborative effort between Dean Wesley Smith and his wife, Kristine Katheryn Rush. (Sandy Schofield is the pseudonym they chose for the collaboration.) If you are familiar with (and fond of) the individual work of either of these writers, you might want to try this one. But I can't say that I was overly impressed.
Example: [Hot Tub Time Machine] I was sure this movie was going to be stupid, and I falsely believed that all the funny parts were shown in the commercials. I was so wrong. This movie is actually funnier than The Hangover! I'm going to watch it again as soon as it comes out on DVD.
Example: [Disgusting work] I hated this film. It was long, and didn't make sense. It tried to scare people, but it was more pathetic than scary. I don't think I even got a little bit scared in this film. This is the worst movie in the Jurassic Park Francise.
Example: [Charger killed my phone] I bought this charger for my LG CU500. After less than 30 minutes of charging, it killed my phone. I tried resetting my phone, took the battery out and put it back in, but nothing helps. My phone is dead. There is no response to my email from the company, overall this stands as one my worst online shopping experiences
Example: [poor choice of bilge pumps] sounds good on paper does not function automatically. If you want peace of mind use traditional float switch for auto function. Gradys was the only positive part of this purchase.
Example: [Used MS Money program] Couldn't use it : unsuitability with my computer leading to irreparable (at reasonable cost with no guarantee of result) password problem.
Example: [Same old song] I found this book lame and passe. The views expressed have seen print in seeming thousands of self-help books that came before. The story itself derivative of classic folklore including Paul Bunyan and John Henry. Just as the book suggests leadership cannot be found in a small pill or encapsulated in The Leadership Pill's pages. If you want to read about leadership invest your time reading about great leaders and judge their actions for yourself.
Example: [pains me to write this] i love to read erotica. and i've enjoyed other collections edited by marcy sheiner. but this book is such a disappointment. the stories are mostly fine stories. but i don't buy collections of erotica for "a" story. usually women's erotica offers stories that are exciting from psychological, intellectual, and sexual angles. sadly, most of the stories in this book have none of these qualities to offer.
Example: [flat] this disc is very flat.i saw it coming when Too Short got down with Jermaine Dupri.this album is nothing but a Commercial Project.it's a sad day when an Artist that has defied the Industry and done his own thing stoops to this Level.he has lost his edge&flow.
Example: [Not thrilled] This is a strange instrumental reworking of the songs from Ram. I bought it because in general I'm a Macca fan and wanted to 'complete' my collection.The reworkings are interesting only for curiosity's sake. The album I think was put together by him on a whimsical notion - hence it was never released under his name.Not worth getting unless you desire the whole set of Macca's works
Example: [Buyer beware!] This is the first time I feel strongly enough about a product to write a review. I bought it at Lowes and used it for roughly 2 years before it became completely useless. During the time it was useful, it wasn't necessarily smooth running. Sometimes it worked well, other times it seemed out of balance and lacking in power. As of last year (2007), it is useless. If (BIG IF) it starts, it idles very roughly and dies when any attempt is made to speed it up. Impossible to use. I tried higher quality fuel; I've taken the carb apart thoroughly cleaning it; I've checked the spark; etc. Nothing helps. I've also discovered through searching the Internet that others have had similar and other problems.It could be that I was spoiled by the Craftsman trimmer I had for eight years. I bought it used for $50 and it was still working well when I gave it away.Don't waste your money on this Troy-Bilt trimmer!
Example: [Great read] As a Beatles fan and a lover of things of this nature(weird true tales) I loved this book. It was so fun to realize how easily America runs with a sensational piece of crazy journalism and treats it as a topic for 11 o'clock newscasts. As a film student I see this book as wonderful material for a film, hopefully done bt me.
Example: [Disappointing] This GBA game is quite challenging, but that's not my problem with it. The problem is the graphics is low-quality and the levels very repetitive. There's very little to do other than shooting your way around, and all the soldier enemies look the same. The tiny dots that make up the enemies make it difficult to aim and shoot, so the challenge frequently turns into frustration. All this is not helped by rather poor sound effects. I do not recommend this FPS, at least not for purchase at the current high price. I hate myself for falling for the James Bond license and wasting $30.
Example: [First Rate Jam] If you like melodic and jamming jazz, you'll love this concert. The Amazon review misses the point when it says the problem is in the material and they bemoan the "jamming" --- what do they expect, structured chamber music?? Whether playing old or new material, the beauty of the jamming is in the execution, and this ensemble of musicians do a fine job of presenting a variety of material (which jams) in a very well-paced, entertaining show...that is, for anyone who loves up-tempo melodic jazz.
Example: [Quirky, mystical] This album is great for many reasons, none of them terribly formulaic. Once again Morrison has chosen to experiment with different musical forms and the result is an excellent, albiet quirky, album. The most memorable parts of the album are "So Quiet in Here" and the beautifully joyful song "In the days before Rock n' Roll." Van's voice sounds amazing throughout the album.
Example: [Models from past cycles] The season is pretty good. It is very cool because they are models from the past cycles. Watch the cycle! At first I thought I wasn't going to enjoy it but I did! I still did like the past normal cycles better thought thats why I gave it 4 stars.Thank YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Example: [A+] Good puck arrived exactly as expected. I have used these pucks and they do the job quite well. Hopefully I won't have to put them to the test again.
Example: [Kind of lame] Not very challenging and not the most clever of rules. I don't really see the interest and neither did my children. Maybe 1-3 year olds would find it fun, but not older. The rules don't match up to how the game proceeds, they don't make good sense, just kind of lame and definitely run of the mill game.
Example: [LOVE THESE SPOONS] Perfect size. I have some for some spices that I use in my cooking. I also have a 2 year old. I use these spoons for some baby food etc. Perfect size I love these I am ordering more.
Example: [The Happening] The Happening really fools you into believing this movie will be great. From the beginning to the end, this movie fails to deliver. There are some things in nature that we will never understand/comprehend. This movie has no real answers, no real twists and was overall unbelievable which is not much fun.
Example: [I was up and running with Fortran in 5 hours] I needed to learn Fortran quickly and this book helped me to do it in 5 hours flat. Just type in all the worked out examples and you are on your way. The book is also a good reference.
Example: [Excellent Product] Very easy to use and set-up. Got it working in less than 10 mins! Slightly on the expensive side, but the modem's range and reliability more than make up for the extra cost!!
Example: [good stuff] All good except that it can't consider the lights coming from side face which sometimes would cause a bad affection to your sight.
Example: [Awkward... why not keep it simple?] A small simple keyboard demands a small simple case. This is **NOT** it. The two pockets with Velcro closures should have been omitted. The whole idea of a PDA is that it can be put in a pocket where it's always handy -- and a keyboard (slim to start with) is the kind of thing that should fit into tiny crevices, much like a paperback book slides into a briefcase. The goofy pockets catch on everything, and make the case almost twice as thick. Also notice that they both face in the SAME direction. It is especially hard to put rigid items in the 'blind' pocket -- and to get them out -- unless the GoType has already been removed from the main compartment. I have thought about carefully cutting the pockets enirely off the case, but I have hesitated to do so... it seems such a drastic solution... -- This is a classic case of overdesign with inadequate forethought, and (I'm convinced) no field testing. --
Example: [Bought two of these doormats got BOTH stolen] That is how good this mat it. It's SO popular.I bought it and placed it outside my house and BOOM! It got stolen.The second time, I CEMENTED GLUE my doormat and it was really stuck on the ground... and then BOOM! Someone decided to actually take the time to spatula my doormat and steal it AGAIN.That is how popular and awesome this doormat is... -_-
Example: [I am garbage] a horribly misguided attempt at satire. I'm honestly appalled that a publisher would even read this book, let alone pick it up for publication. SAVE YOUR MONEY.
Example: [new formula] I have been a loyal Cytomax user for 12 years now. Bring back the old formula. Stevia is just too bitter. I will not buy until it uses the old formula.
Example: [Choppahead] It is a little difficult to rate because I have not received it yet. There are many products I have not received but have paid for them as Choppertown dvd also. Please contact me because I have stopped to buy due to poor delivery. I think it is outrageous that Amazon.com can not deliver products!!!!! See for your selves; purchased Aug. 2006! It is not to believe. I have sent you e-mail about this before, still no answer???regards,Andre RifaatCell: +47 906 37 232
Example: [the clock sop] This story is about a girl named Christy and boy named Danny. They wanted to go to the field to go see the horses, so they asked their mom and she said, "No."They said, "Why can't we."She said, "Because you can't go by your self, you're not big enough." So ten minutes later they snuck out.I liked this Book because horses are really pretty. I think should read this book because it is good.
Example: [POS] This POS broke on first use after being hit by a snow ball....is'nt that supposed to be the idea????!?!?!?!?? Avoid Aviva products if this is a representation of their quality.
Example: [Disappointment with revised, shortened version] Having heard the original, much longer version, I purchased this CD expecting the same. I found the shorter version hard to keep replaying because the examples just became to repetitive. Would much rather have the four discs any day.
Example: [Far from scholarly work] I am in a quandry as to how this book could be rated as highly as it is here. Anyone reviewing this book with no agenda should beable to see this work for what it is, pap.Having read and thoroughly enjoyed "The Druids" by Jean Markale, an authority on pre-christian pagan religions in general and Celtic culture & oral traditions in specific, simply thumbing through "Diverse Druids" made me realize this was the work of an armchair amateur on the subject.Rife with the author's far fetched and unsupportable speculation, and reaking from redigested information that is basic knowledge to anyone with a cursory knowledge of the Druids, this is far from a scholarly work.
Example: [Guaranteed to soothe your baby!] I received this tape as a gift when my child was born in 1992. She loved it then and loves it now. The music is calming and sends her to dream land in minutes! A great baby gift!
Example: [Lotus Guide Magazine Review] Candida Albicans: Could Yeast Be Your Problem?By Leon Chaitow, D.O., N.D.Candida albicans is a yeast that exists in all of us. Normally it poses no problem, but with everyday stress, consumption of refined carbohydrates, and especially the widespread use of antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs, and birth-control pills, it can take over one's body and cause a whole variety of problems. This book eloquently explains how this pathogen gets out of control, causing fatigue, depression, chronic pain, digestive disturbances, skin problems, ear infections, and allergies, to name a few. What I appreciate most is the author's emphasis on non-drug therapies to support reclaiming a healthy internal environment. He uses the latest research and his own clinical experience to show how to detect whether yeast is the problem behind your ills.Susie Richardson, N.A.E.T. Practitioner (Lotus Guide Magazine), Chico
Example: [big shoes to fill] Though this movie is still worth a look, by being an unofficial companion to "paris is burning," there is a lot to live up to. That documentary has an almost effortless quality, getting to the reality and personalities of each of it's characters with an unparalleled ease. This successor at times seems forced, without a real logic behind why the subjects are special or why the ball scene still holds our attention. It's as if the director's vision was too broad. Maybe there was so much to tackle that a sole topic couldn't be picked. Still, its worth a look. You get to catch up with several familiar faces and see where these great underground artists have found themselves later.
Example: [Annoying - another movie without an ending - how French!] Here we go again! This begins as a paranoid thriller and ends up nothing but a tease. A man shaves off his moustache and no one notices. He can't convince them that he ever had one. Is is a plot by everyone in his life to drive him insane? We never find out. The movie ends very abruptly without ever explaining what is happening. A complete waste of two hours. The mystery is never solved. My guess is that the writer was too incompetent to come up with an ending. Don't waste your time!
Example: [Wears out quickly] I used to wear these shoes daily. Within 1 year, the stichting along the top of the toe came unraveled on one shoe such that I could see my sock while wearing the shoe. The soft leather at the back of the shoe along the achilles tendon became ripped up on both shoes with less than one year of wear. These are extremely comfortable shoes, but don't expect them to last. $150 is way too much money to spend on a shoe that falls apart in less than a year.
Example: [Very good!!!] Five go to smugglers top was da bomb! I liked it a lot, but I hated the part for Marybelle been so shy and quiet, but it was the best for Anne! I liked Sooty the most and his maid. that none forgiving Block was who I hated the most.If you feel like reading an adventure book get this one!I do wish Enid Blyton was alive and writing
Example: [LOVE] This is what you need for frosting cupcakes. You can't find these huge tips at a regular store. They are BIG. I can fit a finger through the larger ones. They are really well made, too. I love the cleaning brush and the storage container they come in although mine, unfortunately, arrived cracked, despite the adequate packaging.
Example: [Doesn't work as advertised] I followed the directions exactly, and it didn't work as advertised. The hair did not easily slip out, it came out the same as with normal tweezers. The hair also seemed to grow back as it normally would in the normal amount of time. The tweezers are also not very good quality. I prefer to use a pair I paid $0.99 for.This product is a total waste of money in my opinion.
Example: [Horrible - and downright dangerous] We bought this (twice, actually) for our baby's room. The first Vornado room heater we bought stopped working after less than a week. It would click on and off constantly, each day making more and more noise until it finally stopped giving off heat altogether. We thought it was just a defective unit and wanted to give it another try since we liked the idea of a non-kerosene heater. Within a few days of operating the second one, we again experienced the same jarring noises. One night I went into my daughter's room and almost passed out. Without adjusting the controls, suddenly the heating element went haywire and jacked up the temperature in her room to over 90 degrees. She had already been bundled up in fleece sleeper with a blanket over her. It's a miracle she didn't die of heatstroke. The unit went back the next day and we bought a kerosene heater that has been working well and consistently for almost 3 years now.
Example: [Down alternative comforter] I bought this last year and I have been very pleased with it. it is very soft and warm I use it as a top cover on a flannel top sheet in the winter.It is a nice size covers my queen bed..It is a good alternative to down if you are allergic to feathers like I am.The only bad thing about this comforter is it needs to be dry cleaned but then all comforters needs to be dry cleaned because they do not fit in an average size washer very well. I would recommend this highly
Example: [Reprint of the OR material] This book is a simple reproduction of most of the Official Records (OR's) material regarding Parson's.It is a good source for reference material, but does not contain much original material in assessing Parsons. It is unclear if the material is complete, or just a partial collection of the records pertaining to Parsons Command.
Example: [Collapsed and almost killed me] Bench collapsed and almost killed me after a month of use. A bracket bent like a tin can and snapped off a leg. I called the company and they said they would ship a replacement part. I waited a month for the part and never came. Finally called again today, back ordered for 4 months (probably because many are breaking). You should buy the Ironmaster bench. Best bench I have ever owned, invest now and it will save you dollars and maybe your life. Apex sucks ask my ribs.
Example: [Really terrible book] About half way through I almost put this book down. I slogged through almost to the end. But when two more innocent people were murdered, for no reason (it didn't advance the plot at all)I finally gave up. That was about 20 pages before the end of the book. I really wish I had stopped half way through. Actually, I wish I had never picked up the book in the first place.What didn't like about the book? 1) the heroine was not at all likable or someone you could relate to, 2) the hero was non-existent and 3) there were three murders of innocent people that were in no way necessary for the plot.Don't waste your money or time on this book.
Example: [Spruce up your kitchen!] I love these wall-mounted openers and have bought a few for friends. The quality is good and they make a nice addition to a kitchen cabinet or other location that would be handy for this sort of thing. Recommended!
Example: [Excellent book for teaching English writing ++] This book helps high school and college students improve their writing by providing clear, straightforward, and excellent examples of grammar, punctuation and sentence structures / usage. It has a short but very useful section on the process of writing / drafting an essay (it does not go into in-depth explanations on thesis paragraphs building etc. etc.)I love it and my students love it. I use it for ESL teaching as well as for native speakers developing their writing skills. The book is also well designed, with spacing that makes the text friendly and accessible rather than daunting. The photos are very good - normal people doing normal things, easy for readers to identify with and understand.
Example: [where are the extras] loved the show - sad it was canceled. would have given it 5 stars except there are no extras on the dvd - the websites had commentary and it would have been a excellent addtion for the shows fans.
Example: [BOOO!!!!] GREAT SERIES!!!! IF you can get past the annoying dubbed elevator music! OR the loser trying to mimic Joe Satriani on a guitar! I would have never asked for this series if I had known...Shame on me for not reading the reviews first!
Example: [Amanda Only] You gotta really love AB,Which I do... But even for me, It was hard to watch,Lousy story = lousy movie.Makes me want to watch "SHE'S THE MAN" for the 37th time.
Example: [Unrealistic] This movie claims to be based on a true story, but anyone with half a brain will quickly identify the unrealistic parts. Some in the scenery, some in the costumes, but most obviously in the overall portrayal of prostitution as being an envious way of life.
Example: [The holy grail...] For me, this book was the holy grail (and is)...this is the way of looking at the fretboard that I KNEW someone had to have the keys to. I felt it was out there, and knew it would help me if I could just put it all together...And here it is.Buy this book. No matter what your level. It will help you. There is no higher recommendation I can give than this : EVERY guitarist SERIOUSLY needs this book, especially if you're a "visual" thinker who needs to understand what you're doing, rather than just reproduce (sterile sounding?) rote memory...
Example: [This is a real disappointment] Angels could be a cool album, but it's just not. I was looking forward to hearing the old Amorphis singer again, in a new forum. He's still awesome, but the rest of the band is just bad. The riffs are unimaginative and the drumming is simple and entirely too bare bones. Really, what ruined this for me, I think, besides the fact that it's boring, is that I purchased and listened to Evoken's Quietus before this album. As far as I am concerned, Evoken are the reigning gods of funeral doom. In fact, they really need to come out with another darn album. Quietus is intense, atmospheric and amazingly complex doom metal. Go buy Evoken's album instead.
Example: [great tips] The book does offer some great tips. However, you don't have to follow the book exactly. Things could back fire. Do what works for your child and don't force anything. There are many suggestions that work such as being persistent and patient. It helped me tremendously with my daughter who has autism. This book was a great inspiration for me on how to help my child find ways to get past her food fears.Now she eats a pretty well balanced diet that includes fruits and veggies and less fried foods.Thanx Brenda!
Example: [Works perfectly. Easy setup.] Saw elsewhere in these reviews that this was not a genuine Microsoft product. That is not my experience. The item I received was a legit Microsoft product. Super easy installation with Windows 7 64-bit. Done in 5 minutes.It immediately synched with an Xbox controller I had already, and another 3 minutes later I was using the controller to play Skyrim... the auto-detected and everything. Super, super easy.
Example: [Uggghhhhh...] I can't quite comprehend how anyone, I mean ANYONE... Can actually enjoy this film. I mean gosh... the action wasn't just mediocre, it was HEINOUSLY horrible. Seriously... I have seen better action sequences from an old men swatting mosquitos. And the plot... It was like a bad mix of Pet Cemetery, Highlander, and splashes John Woo and Takeshi Mike elements. I mean come on... How can anyone in their right mind take this movie seriously? The script was litterally conjured up from a bowel movement. And even though I am an avid viewer of asian films and fluent in Mandarin, Cantonese, and Japanese, I couldn't allow myself to give this movie more than an one. Movies like this actually henders the Asian film industry from reaching the upper stratosphere of film making.
Example: [It's about as memorable as yesterdays dinner ....] OK so I bought into the hype about a hot hot novel with super corruption revalations about American big biz tobbacco industry and instead I got a rerun of the A Team 'in print' no less ....To say that our hero, Shane Scully, lacks depth of character would be an understatement and I can understand why he's ready for the rubber room. I can't realy say that I even like the villan, Jody, another cadiadte for the funny farm. When we get to the tobacco conspiracy issues we are in the middle of the book and the author gets really pretty fuzzy here....I mean where's the big secret, a few years ago Colombia had a member of government that was known as congressman Marlboro ...Sorry the only thing biting and gripping in this book has to be the price I paid for it .....
Example: [Contrived Christian Romance] I am shocked by the number of positive reviews on this site. This book was boring, slow, and depressing. Whenever the author was at a loss for what to do next, she simply killed off another character. The plot line was predictable and the Christian aspects were contrived. If you want to read good historical, Christian romance, look elsewhere. You will not find it here.
Example: [Not for Those Who Tend to Get Offended] OK, I'm hooked on "Dibley" and got this particular set because the no. 2 disc in my set of the first three Dibley's broke.I think it is a series worth watching if you are youngish-at-heart, and Christ-oriented or at least don't mind the somewhat-fantasied version of the church scene; otherwise, I'm not sure the acting is worth sitting through (the writing went a bit overboard with some of the characters to the immaturish, and the amateurish). Some of the story tangents are too rude for the conservative, but if you sit back and ignore these directing mistakes and enjoy the goodness in the stories and the characters, it makes a wonderful series to watch, over and over again.
Example: [Works well but...] This product seems to work well and I like that there are no harmful chemicals. However, it has a VERY strong smell that is not that pleasant.
Example: [Needs more power] We have this in the shop where I spend my evenings. It is hooked up to the jointer, and I can tell no difference when this vac is on or off.We have a 1 1/2 hp model with other tools and it keeps all chip outs and sawdust contained, even on the planer. But the single horse model can't handle the load and we end up with shavings from the jointer all over the shop.Pull the hose out of the dust port and try to vac with it and it does absolutely nothing.I suggest you spend the extra $100 and get the extra half horse, it is definitely worth it.
Example: [useful only as a prop] This cocktail shaker was badly made, was difficult to put together and pull apart. Fine if you don't mind spilling the 60oz cocktail all over yourself! Also there was oily sludge in the seams that was really hard to remove.
Example: [Wheel of Time?... Waste of Time!] Utterly, utterly auwful. Mr. Jordan, do yourself a favour and simply disown this book altogether. Just think, you could simply stand up and say 'no, I'm sorry, it was a terrible mistake' then write another book ten, which, hopefully, would be the last in this already hoplessly elongated series.The only reason you should buy this book is as fuel for the fire. And with the amount of drivel Joran puts out, it would probably give quite an appreciable burn-time.Yes, the great, seven-spoked wheel has finally ground to a halt - and to be frank I no longer care.
Example: [Maybe I'm in the minority...] ...but I found this game to be rather . . . boring.I bought it after reading amazing reviews from Playstation Magazine, IGN, and Game Informer.I just couldn't get into it.The moves seemed repetitive to me.The graphics, even for PS2, were lacking.The gameplay was very weak.I'll play this game for a few hours, put it back on the shelf, and not touch it for 8 months.I'll give it another try, and the same thing will happen.I won't touch it for 8 months.Maybe I'm in the minority on this one.I just regret buying this game.I really wanted to like it.I just didn't.
Example: [A fanstastic journey into the life of Lewis!] This book, along with Kilby's "C.S. Lewis: Images of His World" and Hooper's "Through joy and Beyond", is essential for those Lewis fans who like to see the actual photos of where is used ot lecture, walk, talk, etc, along with the other key places in his life. With high quality paper and binding, the text is made up in large part by interviews of those who knew Lewis. This is the best book on Lewis to come out in years. Well worth the purchase! Enjoy!
Example: [It Aint Easy] I have been looking for this music on CD for many years, I am extreemly happy and satisfied.
Example: [This story is the pits] When Romana installs a TARDIS component that the Doctor has been ignoring, a distress signal is picked up and the TARDIS materialises on the planet Chloris, a planet on which metal is in short supply. As they try to find the being who set up the distress signal, they fall foul of Chloris' ruler, the Lady Adrasta, who will do anything to retain her ruthless grip on the planet...Season seventeen of Doctor Who seems to be one in which the show lost its way. As a rule, the stories were less well thought out than they should have been, and contained somewhat ludicrous elements. 'The Creature from the Pit' is one of the worst offenders - science that it would be generous to describe as half-baked, unlikely cultures, and strange creatures all conspire to drown any good points which the story has.If you aren't a Doctor Who completist, look elsewhere.
Example: [Somehow it works] Finally, a hit for Salman!Well, this takes parts of every popular film in recent years (the part stolen from Sherlock Holmes made me felt shamed) but somehow all the parts come together.The film is never going to be receiving awards, and will not be taken seriously, but that is the point.Dabaang is good fun, and good throwaway entertainment.You suspect the film-makers know its limitations, but at least they admit it. I was bored rigid by Once upon a time in Mumbai, another film that blatantly steals from other movies, but is excruciating due to the fact that the makers think they have created a work of art.In short: if it is between this and OUATIM, then I would much rather sit through this again.
Example: [Lucky if they work for you ...] I bought these hoping to have a back-up for my current favorite headphones, which are so comfortable I didn't realize how spoiled I had been. I couldn't wear these, they were too stiff (I like the flexible plastic ones) so first off they hurt my ears = no good, second due to the bad fit, I couldn't hear anything. Now I rated this with two stars because my husband actually uses them. They seem to fit him. So I'm glad they are getting use, but I am still disappointed. I'd suggest looking at other, softer plastic headphones.
Example: [Downton Abbey Season 1 and Season 2] "Downton Abbey" is an excellent series. I have enjoyed every episode of both seasons and look forward to purchasing Season 3. Well worth the money. I will watch this series again and again. There is always more to learn of the history of the early 20th Century and the effects of World War I on families in England.
Example: [no music] You have a comment space for those that have listened to the music on this cd and there is no hypertext to allow one to listen to the cd. How can one evaluate the cd if you cannot listen to it?
Example: [Given wrong book] I was given the instructors edition not the student not what i paid for whats so ever so upset i just want my money back as this point
Example: [Great things in a small package!] I paired 2 of these 6751s with a 6750 polk audio package and an onkyo 605 receiver in a 16x16 theater room. I figured since we just finished the basement I would try to think to the future so I wired for 7.1 even though a lot of things still just play in 5.1. I'm not an audiophile but the sound is crisp and clear. I have an Xbox 360, xbox, and wii hooked up through the receiver to the 58" panasonic plasma. The surround sound is fantastic on games, movies, and tv! I definitely got my money's worth with these speakers! Amazon had great prices and delivery was quick.
Example: [Find it elsewhere !!] I ordered the item and I guess it was on back order, but no one let me know. So I waited and waited finally I sent them an email and was informed of the status. Took forever to receive the item I would never buy from them again !!
Example: [THE BEST CREEPY MOVIE!] ONE HOUR PHOTO IS OF THE MOST CREEPY FILMS I HAVE EVER SEEN ROBIN WILLIAMS DOES AN EXCELLENT JOB IN THIS FLICK, BUT THERE IS ONE THING I DON'T UNDERSTAND, I DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE ENDING ALL I SEE IS PICTURE OF SY PARRISH WITH THE YORKINS I SEE WILL YORKIN HUGGING SY, DO THEY RELEASE HIM OR WAS THAT PICTURE FAKE OR REAL OR JUST SOMETHING TO CONFUSE THE AUDIENCE?
Example: [Their must be a better book on the subject.] This is a poorly structured book. You will find on many occasions the explainations are not complete and what is written is unclear. Their are often refrences to subject matter that has not yet been introduced or explained. Leaving the reader lost. If you are willing to struggle a bit and supplement this book with other material you will find it has some value but for $59... I dont think so. I will be returning my copy shortly.
Example: [Bad size] Garmin GPS coverDon't make my error and assume this cover will fit the popular Nuvi series-there are none.
Example: [good toy,good price,] [...] It took about 10 days for me and my son to get attached to the toy.Now we love it.It moves forward and backward,honks,teaches a,b,c,1,2,3 and 3 shapes in english and spanish.The remote is a good size and shape for my 18 month old son to hold it.
Example: [Double the suggested retail price???] There must be some mistake here. This purports to be the car kit, but the car kit (KPA-H2C) has a suggested list price of $29.95 and sells for that at stores all over. At $59.95, this must be something else but since there is no real description, who knows what. Does this include an fm modulator? That would be a good deal.
Example: [Immensely Disappointing] I fail to understand the purpose of this book. My intent for this purchase was to get an introduction to Descarte's philosophy. To my utter disappointment, i found this book lacking any materials to this regards. The illustrations i found rather childish and annoying. There is no mention of Descarte's philosophy or any other subject that can add value or interest to a serious reader. I am extremely disappointed with this book, every page has an unnecessary illustration, these illustrations have no relevance to the subject. If the illustrations were removed the entire book can fit in 3 pages.
Example: [Very disappointed] Unfortunately we are very disappointed with this wagon. When we first received the box we suspected that this might have been returned by a previous owner by the looks of the packaging. The wagon was missing some parts, however Radio Flyer quickly sent them after a quick phone call. Now the canopy won't snap it securely to the wagon on two of the four sides. I can't put my one year old in one of the seats because he will pull the canopy out. I have to stop the wagon every few minutes and stick the sticks of the canopy back in the holes because they keep coming out. Overall, it just seems to be made very poorly and cheaply. Which is ashame, because my little boy loves it and it certainly wasn't the cheapest choice!
Example: [Eleven on Top] Just wonderful and with the saem characters: All fun to read with great big belly laughs! What a nice change from ordinary books.
Example: [A Must Have] If you are a true Vikki Carr fan your collection is not and will not be complete without adding this CD to your collection,some of Vikki's best songs are on this CD like Unforgetable, With Pen In Hand and of course It Must Be Him, I also especially like Baby Face and For All We Know this is just a small example of what is on the CD so order your copy NOW and enjoy.
Example: [Do not count on the software, 2nd unit stopped working too] After 30 days of use the software gives an error during uploading and never finishes. Seems a number of people have experienced this problem. No solution offered. I would get the cheaper model and NOT rely on the software. I mailed it back to the company to fix it, they just mailed me a new one. Product must be defective with software. The second one stopped working after 2 months.Do not count on the software, but the pedometer works as a pedometer.
Example: [fake rapper] I for one hate this cd. Mainly because He is a rapper from san Fransico who tries to be a hardcore Rapper and Challange people like Jay-z, and Snoop only that to get his (...)kicked in a rap contest by these guys. Dont by bother with this cd if you are a true fan of rap.
Example: [One Use Requires Two Sheets Minimum] The sheets are quite flimsy and thin, so I have found that I must overlay (2) sheets at a time when cleaning a pair of eyeglasses. I lay the doubled sheets flat and then spray them with cleaning solution. I found that spraying the lenses first caused the sheets to become oversaturated and to disintegrate on contact. Even with this approach, the sheets fall apart quickly. I will probably increase to (3) sheets at a time just to get rid of them more quickly. With careful use, they do leave lenses clean and scratch-free, but I will not be buying them again for cleaning eyeglasses.
Example: [Great size to take along] As with most Baby Einstein books, "Dogs" is a great little book. It is a convenient size to stick in your purse or diaper bag and perfect size for baby to hold. Small, but the pictures still bright enough to entertain a little one.
Example: [Disappointing] I am a power Yoga buff and do tapes of Rodney Yee (my favorite) and Brian Kest (if he could only talk less sometimes...).This tape as a number of flaws: the positions are too short, many power positions seem to me to be designed to inflict pain rather than to help the training and finally, the worst, there are some sort of ads during the relaxation phase, the most horrific experience I have ever had with a tape. I jumped up from my Shavasna in horror. I find the voice of the trainer slightly annoying, but that is likely to be a personal problem of mine.In short, I tried it a few times and then tossed it as useless.
Example: [I'm ADDICTED!] I am ADDICTED to ALIAS! This show is awsome. It keeps your intrest the whole epiosode! You need to own or watch all 5 seasons!
Example: [Pontoon post guide on] The installation was seamless and the kit contained all of the parts needed to complete. After installation the pontoon was guided on even in rough water. Much safer!
Example: [For Crafters only, no haberdashers need apply.] I bought this to replace waistband buttons for work pants but found that the fasteners will not hold very much pressure. I replaced buttons on two work pants and both popped back off the very first time I moved. I still use it in craft making as it will quickly attach a button on a decoration. When the connectors that come with the machine run out I will throw the unit in the trash. Oh, who am I kidding, I'll probably throw it in the trash now.
Example: [Misleading] I know, I know, I should have read the description better but hey, it says "Porter Cable 4210 12 Inch Dovetail Jig". Not "Porter Cable 4210 12 Inch half blind Dovetail jig". Anyone would assume you could do a full through Dove tail right? Ok probably not but just be aware of that fact.If you don't mind spending extra on full and mini full through dovetail jigs then the unit is well made.
Example: [Hoover 5507-900 Elite Rewind Upright] This vacuum could be a nice product. I will never know because the BELT buned out the first day.
Example: [In the Cut] This crap absolutely reeked! The story made no sense and Meg forgod's sake keep your clothes on, you are years past nude scenes.
Example: [say huh???] Just for starters, I am an avid MMW fan, and I need everyone thinking about getting an MMW album to think about this......DONT start with this one.....I have a real hard time understanding the other reviewers because to me, this is the least comprehensive album of their genius ever put out by them(I have every MMW release). Im not saying its bad, but if you want the best start with Uninvisible, Combustication, or End of the world party (if you dig grand piano, go with Tonic)....the other reviews are totally mad. Claiming that this is the most inspired and round about album they ever made is like saying the Beatles made better albums before Revolver.....take it from someone who has seen MMW five times in three years and skip this one for next to last (last being Shackman) However, I am not so corny to think Im always right, and in dealing with jazz albums, it is totally subjective as to what is the best....
Example: [Great frames for kids (and grown-ups, too!)] We have these frames in our home to display children's artwork. It's very empowering for the kids to be able to select their own "cover" art and gives them a great sense of pride. Lots of spinning & happy dances! These are much better quality than the knock-off brands. I have also used these frames to display full size magazines. Works great!
Example: [Amanda Caldwell-enrichment] Mr. Yochum's Senior English ClassI think that this movie version of Macbeth just did not live up to my expectations. I thought that Polanski's version was quite boring to say the least. Not that it depicted the play badly but the characters were poorly picked and didn't act very well. I did like the bloody fight scene between Macbeth and Macduff in the end. However, it sort of made me laugh more than anything. Although, the acting wasn't quite up to par, the motif of hands was still used just like in the play. I think Polanski followed Shakespeare's metaphorical use of hand imagery well here by showing the scene with Lady Macbeth sleep walking. Maybe I am to young to judge such a old classic but overall i thought it was pretty cheesy.
Example: [Hp Desk jet Ink cartridge] I bought a desk jet ink 3520 ink cartridge 27 black from E-z ink inc but it dose not work . when I received it and i tried to print out but it does not work at all.
Example: [great system] I got this game as a birthday present the pack had a lot. it came with a cloth,case,head phones,movie remote,demo disc,spider man 2 umd movie,and the charging set. the game played the movie great with subtitles,diffrent languge.and scene skip.later on i bought metal gear acid. it had great 3d grafics and sound. I also bought resident evil 2. it had traliers.subtitles. and looked just has good has it does on the movies.there is not many good games out now but starting september to december you will not be able to buy them all.a list would be metal gear acid,resident evil 2,reident evil,kill bill,kill bill 2,boogeyman,grand theft auto in 3d,midway arcade treasures with mortal kombat 1,2,and 3,mortal kombat deception with the full game arcade,puzzle,chess kombat with konquest mode,namco muesem,frogger. warnig case may scratch game screen.
Example: [Couldn't get it working] I spent about an hour experimenting with the enclosure, different computers and operating systems, various hard drives, etc. with no luck. The green light would come on, and occasionally the computer would recognize that a USB device was attached, but I would never get a drive letter.The documentation is mercifully short but unhelpful.
Example: [Awesome mouse] A great mouse, even for a Mac user. It doesn't support Bluetooth which is a con, but the mouse response seems to be better than any Bluetooth mouse I've used--perhaps RF is just better for desktop wireless mice.
Example: [THE GAME IS HARD BUT ITS FUN !!!!!!!!!] THE GAME IS IS NOT SO FUN IF YOU PLAY IT ALON BUT IF YOU PLAY IT WITH A FREND OR SOMOWN ELS YOU WILL HAVE A BLAST AND THE BEST THING IN HALO 2 IS MOLTI PLAYIR VS IN XBOX LIVE !!!
Example: [Large Speckled Window Perch] I recently adopted a kitten from Siamese Rescue. I was told beforehand that he had vision issues but loved his window seat at his foster's home. I chose this one because I wanted it heavy duty in case the other cat we have (who is the size of a water buffalo) wanted to sit there, too. I read the reviews that it was difficult to use with window sills that were angled, but bought it anyway.We took it out of the box, my husband said this will never work with our 60 year old sills. We put it on the window, and it fits great! No tweaking at all. It's very level, sturdy and does not wobble at all. Unfortunately, the kitten has more issues than we were told about, and is seems to be unable to learn how to jump from one chair to another, to the desk to the shelf. Once he sees Annie-the-water-buffalo jump up there, however, he'll figure it out!
Example: [This is the WORST!] I didn't believe that it could get any worse than "Bitter", then came this "Comfort Woman" thing. Where's the funk? Where's the fire? What happened to actual songcraft (somebody done got lazy on us)? This is music to watch paint dry by! I want my "Plantation Lullabies" and "Peace Beyond Passion" back, NOW!
Example: [Very Nice! Great Price!] It was a much nicer watch than I expected for the price. Service from the seller was exceptional. Everything went without a hitch.
Example: [solid, reserved, not balanced.] This album has some great tracks; Jealousy, Wonder, and my personal favorite, Where I Go, but lacks range. Merchant keeps a dark mood almost untouched throughout her treatments of these songs. The final track is perhaps the weakest, displaying little of her originality and lyricism. This album is well worth the money though, with quietly reinforcing percussion and good guitar work, but isn't a good sampling of her best work.
Example: [ATROCIOUS!!] Don't even THINK about wasting your money on this piece of crap! It will leave you with regret and broken ear drums. The songs on this album are laughable and cheesy, with horrendous vocals and a couple of butchered cover songs tacked on to the ridiculous re-release. Jessica is simply milking her last few minutes of fame and fooling innocent buyers in the process. Don't support this overexposed, overrated, talentless, greedy cash cow!!
Example: [Breaking the Power of Wall St] This traces the story of the development of the Global Financial Crisis. It finishes with a warning that the Obama legislation to prevent Wall St ever again bringing the world to the brink again, is in fact full of loopholes, mainly the fruit of wall street heavy campaigning and distributing largesse in W.ashington.Since this documentary, Obama has appointed quite tough police to enforce the legislation. Expect to see a lot of supplementary legislation to make the banks behave responsibly.
Example: [Much better the Bushnell brand] Much clearer than a Bushnell binocular that I bought and returned. I just wish it could be a little lighter.
Example: [Sad] This book is not only something you could just cry over, it has no happiness inside. I would recomened it to those people who would like to read more about the darker part of life.
Example: [THE ROSA PARKS STORY] This story is about a black women in the days of segrigashon who was sent to jell for not following the rules. It all started when rosa parks refused toget up for a white man and the polic decided to take this inisent lady away. But not any black person blame her for what she did but they did say it was her falt she was in jailin the first place. But you can't realy blame her she was tired of giving in to the whites because they were so cruel to blacks and she was not going to take it any more so she broke the unfear rules and she dicided to make her own. Later on rosa parks started a boycotand changed the lives of millions of black people and thats A great african americn moment.
Example: [Very disappointed :-(] Before I bought mine I read the reviews and reading the neg ones I thought to myself... They probably just didn't use it right... Well.... It really doesn't work, I didn't e even see any gunk in the cleanser and my black heads and white ones r still in my pores... Lucky it's not that expensive but still feel like wasted money
Example: ["The Office" gets endorphins going] My real offices-mates clued me in to this funny program. In fact, when I kept forgetting to tune in on the nights it aired, my boss finally insisted that I go home and watch it - that I would be "quizzed" the next day. It took a few shows to get to know the characters, and now I'm hooked. I have Seasons 1, 2, 3 and have had "Office marathons," watching successive episodes for several hours at a time.The funny thing is that at one time, I did work in an office which definitely qualified for zaniness of personnel. I went home each night, incredulous that work was ever accomplished. Watching the program is funny, sweet relief from real life, getting those endorphins going; and the DVDs are worth having, to view as the mood strikes. Highly recommend.
Example: [One of the worst racing games I have ever played] To sum it up in a word, this game .... The controls are poor, all the cars steer exactly the same, the characters are plain and unoriginal and the circuit champions always have some cheap trick up their sleeve by grabbing the SAME COLOR BLOCK EVERY TIME. The Build-A-Car mode is pitiful, because all the pieces are square allowing no aerodynamicness until you snag Captain Redbeard's set. And what do you get when you beat the game? Nothing. This game is horrible. Leave it to people who like throwing money away.
Example: [bad product] Received the product, but it was all broken when it arrived....the glue on the side didn't stick and the plastic/glass covering was broken...bad quality in production
Example: [One of my all time favorites] This is the kind of book that I want to buy 20 copies of and give to all my friends. Maybe some day I will. I read it over and over again. It's a great book. I love all of Sister's books.
Example: [Used Textbook] Was happily surprised to get this "used" book quickly and in perfect shape -- no bent pages, no writing, not even worn-looking.
Example: [Unusually light hearted and user friendly...] If comedy is, as they say, tragedy in long-shot, then Greg Watkins' take on Caveh Zahedi's semi-fictional love life is exemplary comedy indeed. The scenes with the adorable landlady from hell are worth the price alone. The DVD includes a not-bad commentary track by director and star and an amusing "Day in the Life" of Watkins by Zahedi.
Example: [Easy and fast waffle] It is easy to use, just pour in the waffle batter, about 5 min, you will have a nice hot waffle. The maker is non-stick, and easy to clean. Comes out perfect all the time.
Example: [Excellent water repellent] My daughter's waterproof coat had been laundered several times and was no longer waterproof. I bought Nikwax TX to treat her coat and renew its water-proof functionality. After her coat was treated she wore it on a trip to the mountains with friends to spend an afternoon sledding, throwing snowballs, and building a snowman. It worked great! She was recently caught in a rainstorm while riding her bike, and it kept her nice and dry on her 2-mile ride home. Highly recommend this product.
Example: [The title does not fit the book] I rate this book 1 star because its title "Programming Dynamic Character Animation" does not explain what the book is actually about. The book covers an engine that you could potentially write a character animation system on and static character animation(keyframes). There is no talk of even inverse kinematics. The only reason I could imagine why they would use a title like that is get novice programmers who are interested in dynamic character animation to buy it. I feel sorry for anyone who buys this book. It should be taken of the shelf as mis-information.
Example: [WON'T EVER SHIP!] This order has been the HUGEST pain in the ass. This product and it's inability to ship is uncharacteristic for AMAZON.I placed the order back in early July and I am still waiting for it. The pain in the ass part of it is that twice a week I get an email asking me if I still want it and to "approve" the delay.It is so annoying.I loved this movie. I loved the music and the story behind the music in a part of town I never knew growing up in Houston.I can't wait to hear the songs but I am about to give up.Order this if you have a Metric Crap Ton of patience and you are not in a hurry.
Example: [I gave this away] Not what I expected. I thought a square tree skirt would be different, it was. It has no ties in the back so it never stayed together. It was also the material of a throw blanket and it looked just like I cut up a blanket and put it around my tree. After a week of frustration I gave it away.
Example: [Highly recommended for neophyte UNIX programmers.] Steve Moritsugu and DTR Business Systems' Practical UNIX is recommended for UNIX programmers who seek a reference book of solutions for common UNIX problems. From modifying and compressing files to determining how to extract fields and using networking capabilities, this expands upon the UNIX platform of knowledge.
Example: [Farmall cub research] I bought this book because my late grandfather owned a farmall cub that has several implements, although it belongs to my uncle now I wanted to research it for its originality and the year it was made, a very informitive book.I found the book to be very accurate in where to find the information I needed on the tractor itself as well as learning about the other tractors Farmall made.
Example: [Only the best living poet.] Forget Seamus Heaney, forget Galway Kinnell. Paul Muldoon is the thing. This is an excellent collection of his work. Click around here, find and read a couple of his poems, and you'll know.
Example: [Nothing but trouble] I realize that not every printer will be as bad as mine, but I have had a plethora of problems. The on/off light burned out within 2 weeks. Practically every time I print something, I have to clean or realign the nozzles. For a while, the printer wouldn't work unless it was turned on before the computer. And if this is being miserly with ink, I'd hate to see what regular ink use is! You get what you pay for, I suppose.
Example: [Made me want to cry!] When I first read this book, it seemed interested because of the way the cover of the book is and how the words she said actually came to heart, at least, my heart because it made me think back how I grieved when my grandfather died in 1998. The book made me want to cry! But really, Maria Shriver is a good writer and I can't wait to get my hands on her next book!
Example: [Poorly manufactured and will stop working on you - I Promise.] Freeze ups in the middle of songs, constant resets with a paper clip, and finally the nasty "upgrader" message.. i.e means your up the creek without a paddle. Sending mine back for a replacement and hoping the problems are fixed.Not Happy.
Example: [Great book] This is a great book except I prefer the edition in the original language. The translations partly minimumize the puns.
Example: [Waste of money] For Christmas, I ordered 2 volleyball posters for my daughter. I was very unhappy with both posters. There was no mention in the description that they would arrive folded in quarters instead of rolled up. There were deep white creases across both posters due to being folded. This is extremely noticeable on the poster with the black background. The website also did not list dimensions-irregular size-17"x22"- will not fit regular size poster frames. These posters remind me of what used to come free inside a cheap kids magazine. Complete waste of money!
Example: [Defective Wranglers] The middle of the right front pocket was riveted to the right pant leg. The jeans were unwearable. These pants were definitely defective.
Example: [Not so great] When i received my video, i used it everyday for about 3 weeks, at the same time i went on a low fat diet as suggested and still the video did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. I think i could have done a better work out. I am a professional dancer and do not think that this video is effective. Next time, i'll stick to a personal trainer. If you buy this video, you are wasting your money!
Example: [Touching Account; No New Revelations] This touching account forces the reader to evaluate his own life in the light of the wisdom Morrie offered in his final days. But, I couldn't help but think throughout ... I've heard this before. An effective new channel for an old message about the truly important things in life.
Example: [The movies are much, much better] This book is the reason I've sworn off ever reading "classics" -- they're wordy and boring. This book feels like Carroll's attempt to "astonish" 19th-century adolescent girls. Wow! yet another impossible situation! Stick with Disney's & Depp's movie versions -- they're much more fleshed out.
Example: [110% satisfaction guaranteed] The movie itself is a perfect 100%. Good acting, good writing, good story. However, since I'm supposed to be reviewing the product, that is, the DVD and not just the movie, I think I'll give it a bonus 10% because it's got a lot a really neat DVD extras, like bloopers, deleted scenes, and behind the scenes production numbers.
Example: [Great toy] I bought this for my nephew. He loved it as soon as we pulled it out of the box. The only thing that would make this better would be to add a little more power to the drill. It wouldn't take the screws past about the halfway point. But it is still an awesome toy!
Example: [unsatisfying western romance] I've enjoyed a few of Ms. Joyce's novels, even the very un-PC "The Conqueror" but this one left me with a sour taste. With too much violence for a romance novel, at least for my tastes, and an unappealing heroine, by the novel's end I was left with a feeling of exhaustion rather than exhilaration.
Example: [A Multitude Of Mercies] This book is excellent. Anyone with schizophrenia in their family needs to read it. Written from the families viewpoint, makes it even more valuable. I highly recommend it.
Example: [superb] This is the greatest popular music album of the 20th century. Period. Apart from it, only Abbey Road, by The Beatles, shares the top position of creative innovation in the history of contemporary music.
Example: [Cool] It was cool. Same concept and stuff from the earlier Civilization games. Just looks a lot better. No problems here.
Example: [A Classic] HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES is a fantastic and classic horror film. The reason I saw this movie is because I enjoyed Rob Zombie's music {White Zombie and solo} and I thought it was cool that he was taking a intrest in love of horror films and he was actually going to make one and knowing from the music videos and cd's I knew it was going to be good and I was right. I'm a not fan of more recent horror movies {except for the remake of the "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and "Dawn Of The Dead"} cause I think the horror film genre has went down hill after the 80's. I really enjoyed this movie cause its like a classic horror movie and its set in a cool time peroid and its not one of those horror movies that make things so techinal. This is one of the most original horror movies that I have seen in a long time. I just hope the sequel is just as good.DVD: The DVD was alright but I would like to see the unrated version.
Example: [Excellent case for Pentax K200D] I bought this for a Pentax K200D and it fits quite well; there is a little extra space around the camera but not enough that the camera moves around inside. With the camera inside, the case balances well on the hard "cap". There is a velcro-secured pocket under the zipper lid, and a small zipper pocket on the outside front. Both are large enough for a filter or two, or memory cards and an extra battery.The included shoulder strap is of the el-cheapo variety, but functional nonetheless. The belt attachment is sewn-in and requires you to thread a belt through the case. I prefer the twin loop snap/velcro attachment of a similar LowePro case I saw in a local camera shop (which attached well to two rows of MOLLE webbing), but the LowePro seemed less sturdy and more expensive.
Example: [Coulda Been Great!] What could have been an exciting read is weighed down by superfluous description... after description... after description. I found myself wanting to edit the book - I couldn't focus on the storyline anyway! I'm glad I got this from the library and didn't waste money on it!
Example: [Incredible and emotional] I first saw Pavlo in a little restaurant in Birmingham Al. They were just passing through and stopped in to play. It was right after the release of His Fantasia cd. We were blown away. Since, I have introduced many people to them. I just got the Mediterranean Nights DVD. It is absolutely incredible. The talent, skill, and raw emotional. Unbelievable. It is truly a must see. Brian Richmond Virginia
Example: [Does its job] This water additive does it job of keeping dirt and hard water lime etc afloat in the water and making it easier to maintain the Venta humidifier/air washer. It was promptly delivered at a price lower than I can buy it locally.
Example: [Completely Unimpressive] I've never seen the show live or heard any other recordings so I can't say if it's Cabaret it'sself or just this movie that's bad. I found this film to be so boring and the music so annoying that I turned it off after 40 minutes. If you're a fan of Cabaret then you might like this (I really wouldn't know) but all in all this is a really tiresome film with only a few worthwhile moments
Example: [Excellent but the description is wrong] Okay I saw the movie just a few hours ago and none of what is described above is what I watched. Okay, yes a couple did clam to be forced to do acts infront of a camera but the rest of it is bogus, least the one I saw (it was a close to final film).Now to tell you a little about the movie, I'm not one for giving anything away so I'll leave it more as a "who done it" kind of movie.Silent Voyeur was leaps and bounds beyond what I expected from Georg Koszulinski. His first film Blood fo the Beast, was rough but anyone could see he had a story to tell and given the funds he could tell it, well Silent voyeur is it.The movie was at a perfect pace and always had you feeling wrapped up in the events. A great pychological thriller that should not be over looked.
Example: [Works but not touchable] It did work, but it made my hair feel disgusting. If you just need it to look fuller, but don't ever want to touch it, it's great. I think the TIGI little pump bottle (purple round dispenser) works even better, but still leaves a residue that makes my scalp feel like it is suffocating.
Example: [Generational touchstone] Okay, I'm 19 and most every other 19 y/o I know has seen this film, I mean it's like everyone around my age range has viewed this film and loved it. It's a great film and I just wish I was going on the adventure with them. I didn't want it to end. Hey Steven, do us a favor and put this on DVD! We need this! I've been watching this film on television for years and the nostalgia just kills me! I love it!
Example: [Alec Guinness is George Smiley] The movie, while good, does not do justice to the story. You need to see the Alec Guinness mini-series. I love Gary Oldman and he does a good job but the story is too neat, too easy, and worked too hard to fit into the 2 hour movie format. After watching the Gary Oldman version it just slapped me in the face how really good the diabolical chess match with Karla was in the Alec Guinness version, especially considering it was 1979 vintage. Even with that comparison there were still several very good scenes in the movie.
Example: [Large amount of space, but might not always work] This Gamecube Memory Card appears to have everything: Decent price, huge storage space, Nintendo branded. However, many people are having issues with the Nintendo Wii correctly reading it. That's not to say it doesn't work for everyone, I'm sure there are cases out there where it does. The internet seems filled with cases like mine, however. When you go to save a game on it, Gamecube games on the Wii do not recognize the card.
Example: [One word for this doll.......that is.....hmmm...] WOW!!!!!She is pure pretty....I love pinkhair..and her dress!!!So what if her legs are painted??It's cool!!Only barbies got the idea!!!Her hair is soooooo pretty!!!I reallllyyyyyyy like the curls!I wished I had hair like hers......ah well....I can dye my hair pink at least.....ok back to the doll....i was a little dissapointed how delicate the wings are....because after taking her out, Put her in the suit case and her wing bent....well I fixed it anyways.It's a good toy....really.Hope this Helps!!Barbie Fan
Example: [I love my best friend] a very heartfelt and warming movie. It shows that a dog is a man best friend that gives you that bond that you cannot live without. The characters are so great in the movie. I truly enjoyed this movie.
Example: [Hope all his future prdications never become true] Hope all of his predictions on our coming future never become true. May God Bless this World and its Living Beings.
Example: [Bitter taste] The seeds sprout well, it is true, but there is a bitter taste to this mixture. I use them on sandwiches and I thought there was something wrong with the non-fat mayo. Plain alfalfa sprouts taste much better.
Example: [Troy-Bilt Rear Tiller] The tiller works very well for a small to medium sized garden. It works vegetable refuse into the soil very well, finely tilling the soil. Make sure you fasten the clips on the tires securely or you will lose the clip and the tire will come off. Overall, very satisfied with the tiller.
Example: [Save your Time] It's a great book if you want to read about Mr. Greenberg's life. However, with respect to travel info it falls far from offering any useable advice.
Example: [it deservers no stars.] this the worst emo i have ever heard. The singer whines and writes the worst lyrics i have ever heard and the screamer is a little emo p*ssy. they play 2 power chords the whole song. if like this your a trendy rich brat. can't even belive victory records signed them for a good victory band listen to Martyr AD.
Example: [Bad Kindle Version] This Kindle version is bad. The words are blurry and difficult to read. Buy the more expensive version of this book.
Example: [you get what you pay for] I cheaped out and ordered this based on price. Good for general work and they are a bargin. I am saving up for a better set
Example: [Definately one of the best books I have ever read!] When I first picked up this book I thought, " well, this looks like a good historical fiction book." I was wrong. this book was not good....It was great! I actually read it in a day because it kept me on the edge of my seat. Other than keeping you tuned in, this book had a great moral to it, but I won't tell you because you need to read it yourself!
Example: [Not big enough] The Wii Pro Gamer's Case is a very good case. It does an excellent job of protecting your console. The drawback that I found is that it will only hold two of the remotes and numchucks. I need something that I can carry all four sets of my remotes and numchucks.
Example: [Much of his short fiction is disappointingly pedestrian.] There are some gems here, notably "Fondly Farenheit" and the previously unpublished "The Devil Without Glasses", but most of the short stories are decidedly second-rate. "Galatea Galante" is a clumsy Heinlein pastiche. "They Don't Make Life Like They Used To" is the sort of leaden "whimsy" which has plagued Fantasy & Science Fiction for the last half century. And several of the stories from the early 50's are thinly veiled diatribes against the paucity of original thought in "classic" science fiction. (Bester makes the wholly convincing argument that most of genre is little more than adolescent power fantasies, but fails to provide stories that provide a meaningful counterpoint.)Stick to the novels - THE STARS MY DESTINATION and THE DEMOLISHED MAN, Bester's best work.
Example: [Brantlinger Brings a different view] I really like the book. Her research is done with a select population of women, most of whom went to private schools as children. Thus there is an inherent bias but I think it brings a tangible light to the real divide that continues to grow between classes in America. This was a required reading for a Masters in Education class.
Example: [Boo!!!!!] Horrible Band!-Uncreative-3rd rate rock with mindless lyricsNo wonder their album is flopping on the charts and in sells...
Example: [Disappointing] Dead Tech -A Guide to the Archaeology of Tomorrow dates from 1981, with the English version in 1982 and a 2000 reprinting. Its coverage of dead factories, rail-yards, harbors, and aircraft boneyards is a disappointment. Manfred Hamm's inconsistent mixture of black & white and color photographs give the book a disjointed feeling. The quality of the photographs themselves is inconsistent. A few rise to the level art exhibited by Stanley Greenberg (Invisible New York) and Christopher Payne (New York's Forgotten Substations), while most are no better than I (a decidedly amateur photographer) might have done in a hurry with my trusty Pentax K1000 and a roll of T-Max 100 or Ektachrome 64. The accompanying text by Rolf Steinberg is noisome -- perhaps a victim of a less-than-artful translation into English. I haven't yet decided whether I will hold on to this book.
Example: [Great Book-Worst Seller] This book is great for the information, but I will never purchase from this seller again. Purchased on 4/17, email received shipped 4/18, received another email on 5/2 stating I would receive in a few days. By 5/8 still not received. I sent three different emails and could not get answers, when and where shipped from. I finally received the book 3 1/2 wks after purchase, and the book shipped from South Bend, IN to OK. It doesn't take 3 1/2 wks. even by pony express!
Example: [More than just a sci-fi flick] It would be misleading to say that the movie is just a brilliant sci-fi masterpiece. The essense of the Matrix is profoundly philosophical and spiritual. It actually makes you think about things that other movies try to make you forget about: the reality of this world and how you can personally change it.
Example: [A Cool and Excellent Book] Heidi is loveable, energetic, fun, thoughtful, and interesting. If you're into deep stories about a person's life, you should read this book. You should read it because you will probably find some things that you're dealing with right now too.
Example: [A perfect hit for kids] This movie, although a bit tough to understand for really little kids, remains firmly in my mind even though it has been about nine years since I have seen it. It teaches kids about the wrongs of slavery, and the idea that even a kid can make a difference. I can't begin to express my sorrow since they've discontinued it, I'm considering writing to the prouducer-type-people. Because if there's anything this movie has taught me, it's that no matter your age, you can still change things.
Example: [Barefoot Bride] i am enjoyed reading this book and will get more from joan johnson as the financies allow me to buy more
Example: [Awful] First off it is edited for G-rated material only - no nudity isshown - no swearing is heard everything is bleeped out and there arebig black bars covering anything exposed. So the title You never saw fits - you never see anything.
Example: [Looks great smells great!] I am a fan of turtles so i love this air freshener. It looks great in my green car. The women love it!
Example: [Easy, breezy, done.] Very satisfied with this product. Availability, price, and shipping were made very easy so I could get the item I wanted and have the perfect gift. Would definately recommend to friends and family.
Example: [black?] I bought this cd based on what I had heard in the previews on amazon, and I must say they are way too good for the album. Each song except for rust are hard to listen to for more than 30 seconds, because they are just power chords and screming, there is very little thought behind it, and it sounds like death metal, which was not what I was hoping for. Its not bad but for the black metal that we have heard from Darkthrone its a giant let down. Buy it only if u can listen to each song preview over and over again for 5+ minutes.
Example: [Closed Door] I did not see the value of this bland memoir. W.S. Merwin is a capable writer but the story he tells here will have little interest to any but close family friends and those particularily keen on this minor author's early career. "Without direction or prospect.." Words taken from the book that seem apt.(I do rank the book's jacket design by David Bullen as first rate.)
Example: [Rip-off!!!] Buying this cable is just like throwing money in the trash - cheap HDMI cables will do just as well as Monster. Monster needs to make products that actually have some justice to the price they charge. There is a small difference in analog cables and speaker wire performance, BUT THIS IS DIGITAL - THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE IN TRANSMISSION QUALITY with short distance connections! Cat 5 cabling with a HDMI plug at the end will do just as well!!! I have purchased Monster cables in the past, BUT NEVER AGAIN - this is treating consumers like they are complete idiots!!!
Example: [Kukuwa Dance Workout] I'm not exactly a beginner and the 30 minute segment got me sweating. It has fun combination of simple dance movements. For those who don't dance -me included- the steps are easy to learn after a few times. Remember this is not a dance video. It's a dance workout video. Kukuwa also is very energetic and her personality makes this an enjoyable workout.
Example: [Favorite soup bowl!] This soup is quite delicious. The broth is incredibly tasty and the fried tofu topping were really delicious and added nice texture. This is surprisingly filling given that the who bowl is well under 300 calories. I've tried most of Annie Chun's other soup and noodle bowls, and this is one of my favorite. Will definitely buy again!!
Example: [Excellent live album] The style of this live CD bears little resemblance to Fillmore East but it is nonetheless a very fine CD. Surprisingly, it also bears little resemblance to his then currect "Laid BacK" album either. This is Allman backed with a large ensemble doing a much more uptempo set and without much soloing. A number of the songs included here can only be found on this CD so it is a must for serious Gregg Allman fans.
Example: [Short-lived Relief] I had a flea infestation this year and thought I would try this fogger. I followed the instructions to the letter and even made sure I had more than enough foggers to cover the square footage in my townhouse. However, the results were less than satisfactory. Apparently, it killed the fleas but not the eggs. Within a week, I had more fleas (a lot more).Considering the amount of prep that needs to be done before fogging and the cleanup afterward, I have concluded that it isn't worth the effort.
Example: [love the Robb!] I love the characters the twists & turned all the cases take, the way Eve & Rourk love is so suited to each other. They work so well together. The other characters all have lives of their own but they are so much more when they are together. These books are aces in my book. Please keep them coming
Example: [If Only O.J. Wasn't in it] I love this movie. I remember laughing nearly till i choked all the way through it the first time that i saw it in the theater. I'd buy it right now if only O.J. wasn't in it. I just can't bare to watch the scenes with him in them, he has spoiled one of my favorite movies for me.
Example: [There are better cards on the market] These cards are alright, but the cards by White Rabbit Press are a true 5 star product. The Tuttle cards are small, thin, have only 4 kanji compounds, many of which are not commonly used. They have some typos, and the overall design is kind of ugly--the indentation is not consistent and the stroke order diagrams are handwritten! The White Rabbit Japanese Kanji Flashcards by comparison are beautifully designed poker-size cards with 6 compounds, look-alike characters and *imporant* hiragana and katakana (instead of romaji), and they come in a very nice box. It's hard to get the tuttle cards back into their box.
Example: [Excellently written--could not put down] I disagree with the reviewers who are rather harsh in their opinions about this novel. It has all of the key ingredients to make it an excellent example of the best of its genre. As usual, Cornwell's writing is superb--the suspense is gripping, the action flows throughout the book, her descriptions are vivid, and her characters are real and complex. Unlike some of the reviewers, I find her well-fleshed out characters to be one of the strongest aspects of her writing. I enjoy seeing the continuing story of Kay Scarpetta's world come to life, and I enjoy seeing her interact with the characters that we have come to know through Cornwell's previous Scarpetta novels. I say Bravo to Cornwell, and I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys an excellently-written murder/crime mystery!
Example: [Nat Geo 1152 Medium Camera Pouch] National Geographic products are made with the highest quality material. This is my 3rd bag or pouch & I'm already looking for another. Can't get enough. The pouch is perfect for a light trip to the Zoo or Park & you just need to pack a point and shoot small camera with a memory card and an extra battery. Adjustable over the head or shoulder. You can even tighten it around your waist and wear it on your hip. It has a front pocket for a wallet & velcro's closed. Well worth the money in my humble opinion. Very durable.
Example: [Works Great] This is A Great scale. It is heavy duty .Simply press one button and climb on.It is easy to see weight.The coiled cord allows you to set display at your prefered height.We are very happy with the 349.
Example: [Looks good, durable] Protects the iPod Shuffle, and more importantly, helps to distinguish which iPod belongs to which kid.
Example: [Diary of a Baby, Daniel Stern] It is a remarquable book und shows you an impressiv and new sight on the developement of the newborn child and the babies learning to use his senses during the first year of life.
Example: [twinings is better] Disappointed. Wanted to give it a try but flavor is not as good as Twinings. Costing the same as Twinings.
Example: [Redundance] I like the characters in Debbie's books but she is redundant in her descriptions of the characters very chapter or two.
Example: [unleashed] this album is wak! the whole bow wow concept in itself is lame this album has sunk to a new low even for him!dont waste your money on any one of bow wows albumbecause they all have one thing in common they allhave a corny sound to them!
Example: [Excellent Primer] I heard about this product several years ago and love it. Not sure if it helps with wrinkles but love it as a makeup primer. My face feels like velvet and keeps me feeling young all day. This is a must have for my daily makeup kit!
Example: [Wonderfully odd tales from the same city] The best way to read this book is to know nothing about it beforehand. Maupin has crafted a creepily odd and seductive psychological mystery that needs to tap into your sense of innocence and surprise; it is what you must bring to the read. At more than one point I was caught up with the "Wow!" of the plot. Maupin manages to mix the inventive and the autobiographical in a way that lends resonance to both elements, and if his emotional nakedness does not unsettle you, the strangeness of the story will pull you in.
Example: [I want more] These shoes are so comfortable, you'd think you're wearing nothing at all. Its also skid resistant which is a big plus! I'd tell everyone who asks me about it to go and buy it then again I also dont want everyone to have the same shoe design as me.I'd buy this shoe even at its original price!
Example: [Very Disappointing] I have not written a review before but this toy was so disappointing I had to save others from making the same mistake I did. Our Buckaroo will buck sometimes but it takes at least 10 tries to get his back feet down to play the game. It is something only an adult with just the right touch can do. Very frustrating for everyone. Please do not waste your money on this toy.
Example: [Best since "This Perfect World"] A great album. If there was an option for four-and-a-half stars I would have used it. Incredible songs as always, but what sets this one apart from the last couple is the diversity--akin to "Can You Fly" and "This Perfect World". For that reason, I can't imagine growing tired of it. And it's not just the varied instrument selection and production choices that make these songs so refreshing. The type of writing in the songs themselves varies from the specifically detailed stories--which he happens to be the modern master at--to the more ambiguous "Anyone", to the spare use of words in "Arriving On A Train" in which he lets the music tell the rest of the story. And the more unique strands of Freedy we get the better.
Example: [Chain saw chain] This chain was ordered for a Poulan electric chainsaw. It arrived promptly and in perfect condition. I am pleased with this product.
Example: [A wonderful remake of a wonderful show] One of the great things about this album is how the performances really capture the energy and wit behind Sondhiem's clever lyrics, and wonderful music.Each of the performers goes above and beyond that which they are called upon to do, and the singing becomes infectous. Nathan Lane is wonderful as the scheming Pseudoulus and each line is delivered with such a duality that it never becomes boring to listen to.This is the next best thing to actually seeing the show, and holds a place in my collection as one of my favorites. Wonderful.
Example: [In response to Ashton] Just because they play "math metal" like Tool does doesn't make them the master musicians that Tool is. Dream Theater also uses mathematical signature changes and I don't see any comparisons. I'll admit that the bass player is good, but as for the other musicians... well, they aren't the "best" as you claim. Check out Peter Lingrine (sp? sorry) and Mikael Akerfeld from Opeth for two amazing guitarists, and Slayers Kerry King for another amazing guitarist, Slayers Tom Araya for a better screamer, and Slayers Dave Lombardo for a better drumber.
Example: [Nice way to fill the hole] It's a nice way to fill the hole left by removing the factory stereo. Fits fine and gives you another place to store things.
Example: [Moved to tears every time I read it.] How beautiful! We all are imperfect, crippled in some way. Yet it is those imperfections that God uses best.This is not only a wonderful Christmas story to cherish, but a story to read to children, who are disappointed because they did not make the cut for a sports team, or who feel unpopular, or don't have the best grades even though they try hard. If you are a parent or grandparent, you should be reading this one with children in your lap and tissues nearby. This one is not just for children, it is a classic story for all ages!
Example: [terrible buy] I agree with the other reviewers - I was really disappointed. This too slim volume - especially for the price - is designed for a 5 year old - and a simple one at that. Not a good buy - WAY too little info and annoying hand drawn illustrations- all in all a terrible buy.
Example: [Lousy] This story couldn't keep me interested. The plot wasn't developed enough, the romance wasn't interesting. Skipped through most of the book, never found anything readable after reading the first 80 pages or so.
Example: [Cool Book!] I have owned this book before. It is very cool. I particularly like the Ninth Psalm of Yog-Sothoth and the Ritual of the Silver Key.
Example: [2-3 inches too small!] Others have said it well: but the box, find other liners. These are a couple of inches shorter than they need to be to extend over the lip enough to stay put. And, they're not particularly strong. My cat shreds them or pulls them down to cover her "deposit" ... the later leaves a fresh deposit on top of the liner. Clevercat can do better!
Example: [wwatch] good quality and value. Nice looking. Don't like the bi-lingual days of the week. Day and date are very hard to see
Example: ["This film has been modified from its original version ...] ... It has been formatted to fit this screen."That's the first thing you'll see when you start watching this DVD. The movie itself is pleasant enough, if somewhat derivative. The best thing about it is probably the cinematography of London and the English countryside, but you won't be seeing 30% of the picture in this cropped, full-screen, full-price DVD release. Disgraceful.For some reason, the very last scene in the movie is shown widescreen, so you'll get an idea what the DVD would have looked like if it had been released by a studio that cared about its creative artists or its customers. If only.
Example: [Get a different book] I had to use this book for a sophomore class in college and let me tell you, this is the worst book ever written. Every time I would read this book, I would immediately fall asleep within 10 minutes. Then, I would wake up and try to read some more and fall back asleep. This book threw my whole sleep schedule off and I'm not exaggerating. First, the book is hard to follow. Second, when the author tries to describe something or use an analogy, it makes no sense whatsoever. Some of the vocabulary exercises at the end of each chapter aren't even covered in the chapter. Luckily, I already knew 90% of the topics covered in this book and still got an "A" in the class, but I would suggest buying a different book unless this book is required in one of your college courses.
Example: [Great Concept, Horrible Finish] I read this book because the back cover copy was intriguing. The first half of the book was great, and peaked my interest...But its as if the author stepped aside and let a clueless idiot finish the book...The "Beast" rapes the girl then just walks away...and the girl is fine with it, and gives it up to her boyfriend immediately after? Was this some kind of comedic porno???If an unknown author submitted this garbage to a literary agent/publishing house it would be thrown in the garbage immediately.This book goes to show that well known authors can publish anything and people will buy it.Thank God it was short and I only wasted an hour and a half reading it
Example: [Who looks older: Hunt or Midler?] I agree with all the critical comments here: the plot is hackneyed and painfully predictable; Hunt keeps playing the same role over and over; Firth must've needed the money; Broderick is over the hill; I also agree with the positive reviews, in particular those who note that Bette was the one bright spot. I just couldn't make it to the end. All I could think about was how bad Hunt looked; is she anorexic?. Something seriously wrong here: Bette was born in 1945, Hunt in 1963! While I admire Hunt for her work offscreen getting the book made into a film, I'm afraid it wasn't worth the effort. I'm glad I got this through Amazon Prime. If I had paid for it, I would be annoyed more than I already am for wasting one hour on this film. Admittedly, this wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but it sure wasn't the best!
Example: [Stupid Book] I am shocked to read the other reviews. As another reviewer stated, there is only one word per page and they don't rhyme or even make sense. This book was a HUGE disappointment. I have literally hundreds of childrens books and this one is going to the Goodwill. The words are like, Ball... Oops. Why is the ball an oops? How did it go through the window? This book is just lacking in everything. Don't waste your money.
Example: [a hidden gem] Tried to find this book in a bookstore, and it appears to be self-published, but available online. I can find nothing about the author at all. No matter, this is without doubt the funniest and most unique book I've read in years. It's hard to pin down the story - it's more a free-flight fantasy into the minds of marginally functional people desperately clinging to their version of happiness, fighting the insanity of the `normal' people that surround them. If you ever wanted to laugh at the concept of `coping', this is the book for you. It's great to see a writer on the outermost fringe of publishing produce this sort of work.
Example: [Like it but......] My teenage son was bugging me to give him my Kindle 1 and was very thrilled when the Kindle 2 came out so I would buy it. I really like the Kindle 2, but for $359, why on earth does it not come with a cover? C'mon Amazon, this is a hefty investment in your product and you should have sent a cover with it. I am not impressed with the Amazon cover (which costs another $30) so plan to buy the M-Edge cover, which takes 2-3 weeks to ship. Now I am hesitant to take my new Kindle on vacation - I don't want to risk getting it damaged on the way.
Example: [im only giving it one star because you have to...] ok..to the "brilliant" people who made this...just like most of the MWC fans on here ive been waiting for a season set of MWC...i hear about this piece ...and i thought "hey! they finaly released MWC on DVD woooooo!!!!!"and come to find out..ITS ONLY 5 EPISODES!!! ON ONE DVD TO TOP IT!!!!!i have to agree..why is it that they can release shows like "buffy" and "freinds" but they cant release MWC!!it just proves that alot of these companys dont want to spend time on real classic tv shows..i mean sure theres seasons of the simpsons,M*A*S*H,hogans heros,etc..but theres more "modern" seasons then there are clasics..they wont even spend time on a wonder years dvd collection!but they will for "freinds"!so people...please save your money! hope that we will see a season of MWC on dvd..NOT 5 MEEZLY EPISODES!this is a piece of garbage..you (the fans) want a season...not this 5 episode piece of jargon!"lets rock!" al bundy
Example: [Attention getter] Just put it on a table and watch who picks it ups and starts reading. If you have a quirky sense of humor then this book is for you. Definitely not a page turner, more like, just open it up and enjoy! A friend gave it to me and I have enjoyed watching everyone from my mom to my nieces get a giggle out of any one of the pages. It is the definition of a coffee table book. Buy it and enjoy!
Example: [Clumps, but smells and tracks.] Clumps hard enough for scooping, but there is little to no odor coverage. My cat is long-haired and this stuff is ALWAYS caught in his fur and feet. I have to clean him and sweep the floors after every use-- it's very lightweight and flaky, I assume this is why it's always in his fur.
Example: [Fantastic album] This is a wonderful album. It's very mellow in that the songs are mostly ballads and mid-tempo. It's also a modern country album, but retains a little bit of traditional country. "Ashes By Now" and "Does My Ring Burn Your Finger" are traditional, but not too traditional for me to enjoy."Does My Ring Burn Your Finger" is the best song on the album and my favorite; the opening guitar work in the beginning is so magnificent that I keep putting that part on repeat, and her drawl expresses the attitude in the song. I love sassy attitude songs. :)The rest of the songs have enjoyable melodies except for "Lonely Too," which doesn't stand out. "The Healing Kind," "Why They Call It Falling," and "Stronger Than I Am" are especially touching ballads.This is a very smooth album and it keeps the mellow mood throughout, even on the faster tempo songs. It's a fantastic album.
Example: [Awesome with Ceton infinitv 4 , Drops it 20C] I got this because myCeton InfiniTV 4 Digital Cable Quad-tuner Cardwas getting hot , I put it Directly under it and my Temps went from around 65C to 42C at half Speed which is a huge drop in terms of PC component partsOne negative is at full speed (there is a slider for Speed control) it is really loud but at 1/2 speed where i run it is is not bad at all if not noticeableIt does glow blue which is cool i guess if you have a case that shows it but my case is closed so i don't notice it at all and that's better for me
Example: [Safe, comfortable, and easy to use] After contemplating convertible car seats for a few months while my daughter was still in her infant seat, I decided to order a Britax Marathon. I liked the fact that it would allow me to keep her rear-facing much longer than most seats (up to 33 lb.) and that it would allow me to keep her in a 5-point harness longer than most seats (up to 65 lb.).The built-in lockoffs have been handy when installing the seat in vehicles that would require a locking clip otherwise. The seat cover and comfort foam are very plush (we have the Houndstooth print seat cover) and comfortable. My daughter has always been very comfortable in her Marathon, even on longer trips.
Example: [Fun for a while...] My daughter has loved this soother for almost a year now, but we just discovered that it's been leaking. I thought that the water was evaporating, as the level was lower over the last month, but I discovered liquid dripping out last night. There are no breaks or cracks in the plastic; the liquid is coming from the seams. It doesn't smell like water (kind of plasticky), and, while I'd like to believe it's probably non-toxic, I'm still not going to leave the soother inside my daughter's crib.
Example: [Laughably dated] What everyone seems to miss in this tenditious tome is that it was based on Huey Long and was intended to derail his White House express. For a much superior roman a clef on the Kingfish, read Warren's ALL THE KING'S MEN -- even though it also is very loosely based on HPL's exploits.
Example: [It's better than most litter boxes....] But it's not "the" perfect litter box. Litter tends to leak out the sides when you roll it over. Sometimes, wet litter sticks to the bottom so you have to bang the bottom to get it to fall off. Next, if your cat's stool is a bit runny, and they don't bury it properly, it sticks to the sides and makes a big mess. It's difficult to scoop if you do find this situation before rolling because the entry hole is small. My larger cat tends to only step in half way so his stool is half on the floor.Although rolling most days is easier than scooping, it does go faster when you are in a hurry. If you have cats with perfect litter behavior and don't mind sweeping litter spillage, this may just be a good buy for you.
Example: [This book is sad and depressing.] I gave this book to my 9 year old daughter to read. She started it without me. She told me how sad and awful it was. I decided I should read it with her. She was right. As the story progressed, I was hopefull that the story line would become more positive and encouraging. That just didn't seem to happen. After reading a chapter, last night, I've decided to put the book down and not finish. It was extremely violent and upsetting to the point where I didn't want to even continue. This book is not for children, and not for me either.
Example: [Does the job] It does what it's meant to. Sometimes loses suction and falls off but not often enough to be a huge nuisance.
Example: [Star Trek Voyager] I have the full series on DVD, but since they are not HD they look good on my HD TV.I also have Netflix, again ok.On Amazon streaming there is an HD option, and the series looks great.
Example: [All Our Yesterdays] I bought this cd for one track really "Dancing In The City" and it hassome great other tracks, "Uptown Top Rankin" and "Motorbike Riding" are brilliant.
Example: [Love It] This is great music to fall asleep with if you like Bach or classical music. Very restful and soothing. I often have trouble sleeping, but this does the trick for me. The entire CD is over an hour long so you have ample time to wind down and drift off into to a peaceful sleep.
Example: [Soft, Squishy, gives you a good Grip] It's a little hard to put on, but once it's on you'll forget that it's there. I don't know how well it will handle being removed to change the batteries. Hopefully it will flex without ripping. Colors do improve the look.
Example: [Neck duster? Neck scratcher is more like it.] This brush has a skinny, skimpy tuft of very stiff boar hair whose ends are not trimmed to a uniform length. The sensation of having one's neck brushed with it is quite unpleasant. My memories of the barbershop of my youth is that the neck brush was a soft and soothing finish to my haircuts; this is the polar opposite. It's going back.
Example: [Some helpful suggestions but also some thoughts dated 50 years back...] I got the audio book and listened to it while driving to work. Although hearing some good points on unrealistic expectations I couln't believe my ears when I heard that "day care is the modern version of child abandonment" and that "feminists have messed up so many things"... The author seem to be suggesting to half of her radio audience to give up the double-income model and move to a little town in the middle of nowhere far away from all temptations... It makes me wonder what kind of relationship the author experienced with her own parents and I'm pretty sure I know what Freud would say about this... Overall quite disppointing.
Example: [Great Story. Loved the Symbolism.] I have been a Frank Peretti fan since I first read "This Present Darkness." "House" continues in the same vein with a horror story about the unseen spiritual world. Wars between angels and demons battling for the souls of men. As with most books-to-movies, the books was more detailed and better. The movie had to leave too many things out. But overall, it was a good movie.
Example: [Exciting time travel adventure.] This book is an exciting Sci-Fi adventure involving both time travel and the lore of Atlantis. After reading this book it is easy to see how the author can take sequels in many different directions. This author shows great imagination and the novel was flawlessly edited by an expert.
Example: [If you don't speak French look elsewhere] They never mention that it doesn't have English subtitles. If you don't speak French, pass this one by! It's probably a wonderful movie if you can understand what's going on.
Example: [I would bye the blue one] I got this lava lamp for my brother for fun "because it was so cheap" I recomand the blue because the bubbles are pretty much white and there easy to see. My brother is scared of the dark and keeps the light on 24/7, and the bulb is still fine. They have better but huge ones at "big lots" i don't know if they sell them anymore "anyway there 40 dollars there" I would bye one and give it a try you'll enjoy it, it isn't that big of a deal.
Example: [HORRID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!] I agree with all of the other reviewers in this category, The Ultimate Sin sucked!!! The production, music, lyrics, everything just was way below what Ozzy was capable of. However, at the time, this was a very popular album. Also, the tour was huge. This was Ozzy's glam moment. Gotta remember that this is the type of music folks wanted to hear at the time, including me (sad, I know).Unfortunately, with the exception of No More Tears, all of Ozzy's stuff since Bark at the Moon has sucked!!! Whats up with that? He is still good live, but the new material really lacks.
Example: [GREAT COFFEE BUT BREAKS] I agree with the rest of reviews, Brews great coffee, but likes to break after nine months to a year!!!!
Example: [Still Good] I picked up his first album Domestic Blues several years back after listening to in a record store. About wore it out, really enjoyed the acoustic guitar and mandolin sound mixing folk, country and blues.Had all but forgotten about Bap until I saw him open up for Mark Knopfler last week. They had his new disc for $15 bucks there and once again I'm wearing it out. Nicely produced mellow blend of original songs that I can't get out on m head. Now I'm gonna have to look for the ones I missed.Highly recomended!
Example: [My board couldn't live without it!] If you do your MXR homework, you will find that this pedal is the 'Best of Both Worlds.' With the 'script' button out you get the modern (block MXR logo) phasing. With the 'script' button in, you get the classic 'script MXR logo' sound. The 'block' sound is a more enhanced, full-range phase, while the 'script' sound is a more subtle phase.It's really like two phasers in one.I really only use this to play early VH, with the script button in and the knob between 9 and 10. It VERY accurately replicates that early VH sound. I also use it to play Paul Gilbert's 'Fuzz Universe' with the knob at about noon.I found it better to use this pre-amp vs. FX loop as the phasing was VERY IN YOUR FACE and enhanced in the loop. Placed preamp this gives you a nice subtle phase: You know it's on, but it's not overpowering.I've tried my fair share of phasers and this one really knocks out the competition. Great bang for your buck and a phenomenal sound.!
Example: [Not what I expected] I grew up in the 50's and used to sing along with a lot of records, so I know what the music sounded like. There are 20 songs on this CD, and only 7 of them are the original beautiful recordings. The other 13 songs are sung by someone else, and unrecognizable. Their music quality is very flat and tinny and goes in and out. And there were no samples to listen to. I returned this CD, and am trying to find a good one.Don't buy this CD. It is MORE than half bad!
Example: [College Cult Classic!] This Movie Is A Must See For Any College or University Student Who Is Majoring In Accounting, Finance, or Business. That being said, most of what goes on in this film, is basically an entertaining story line that has a little bit of drama and mystery. I love the Ben Affleck pep talk scenes. I love the "Recko" scene (classic comedy). I love the Wall Street scene. Maybe this film is what lead up to some of the anticipation for "Money Never Sleeps"...who knows? But Never The Less, Boiler Room is a classic in it's own right. And most of all, it's unforgettable. Nia Long is super sexy (not plain Jane). Her character gave the film a different layer substance which was very nice & fresh to see.
Example: [Bad Quality] It took longer to receive this item than it to fall apart. Mirror fell off as i was driving to work.
Example: [Awesome] Man o Man! You just have to hear this! It starts out saying, Today is Sunday and we've got the greatest Gospel Singer in the world! WOW is right! Then at the end when you hear the crowd cheering her on, it's so moving it'll make you cry.
Example: [very good gun] all i can say is very good gun my older brother gave it to me and it had been his for like five years already haven't had any problems dispite its long time of use
Example: [Too Difficult to Use] Yes, these are soft, but they're also not paper towels you can grab for a quick spill. You need TWO hands to get these off the roll. Its like static/velcro. I hate these, and bought the bulk pack, so I have a ton to still use. Give me the traditional, rougher easy to rip towels anyday. Would not buy again!
Example: [Diaper Cake] the product was not as pictured it was all apart in the boxthere was no bear or a stuffed animal they might have put the wru\ong order in the box but supposly the refunded my money I need to wait to see the bill
Example: [Precise and Concise] This is the most precise and concise macroeconomics textbook I have ever seen. I especially appreciate the abundance of colourful figures drawn, which makes it highly suitable for beginners of macroeconomics. For beginners, a good textbook should include the elements that are attractive to dummies. Unlike the other typical macroeconomics textbooks (which are wordy and lengthy), this book adopts the "to-the-point" appraoch which stimulates the readers' reading incentive. And you can finish the whole book in a very short time!Although it is intentionally for undergraduates, it is also suitable for anyone who have done the first course of microeconomics.LAW Ka Chung
Example: [OUT OF THIS WORLD...YOU GO GIRL] Loving all of Chante's music, she seems to write songs that touch moments in your life. We all know that there have been well written songs but the artist was not equally matched. Chante can sing anything and it will be beautiful. Enjoying this CD and waiting for the next.
Example: [Working for me!] I bought this book needing to get fit and loose some weight after nearly 3 months in bed with a back problem. I am now a little more than halfway through it and it is working well. Combined witha healthy diet I am losing weight. The exercise is also giving me more strength and stamina for my everyday life. I can now go out for a day with my husband without having to call a half after a couple of hours and be taken home.Worth twice the price!
Example: [I hate the clips] My rollers are constantly popping out of the clip holders from this set, regardless of me using more or less hair. Maybe there is a magical perfect portion of hair to roller ratio. If so it is impossible to find. I dunno, but I do know I would NOT recommend these. Also even when I get these to stay in my hair, my hair doesn't curl nearly as much as it usually does in hot rollers. Overall buy something else.
Example: [Worse Than Legend!] I should know better by now than to trust a Mark Dacascos movie. This film is an insult to Matheson's orginal story. Dacascos' acting hasn't improved a bit. Even his kung-fu skills seem to be fading away.I'm so tired I don't even want to finish this review, so I'm not . . .
Example: [Dreadful] This movie is absolutely terrible. Do not waist two hours of your life watching this film. Poor sub-titles, no action, and a little perverted, too. I'd rather sit in a doctor's waiting room than to have watched this movie.
Example: [Broken] This humidor was a gift for my Brother-In-Law, and arrived with the glass shattered. I was very disappointed, and will not order from this company again.
Example: [Excellent specific and general ideas] He is always good....great reminders and specific information as well as general affirmative statements..have not finished it yet
Example: [Standard Kundera: brilliant] The great thing about Kundera novels is that they say things. This is a big problem with a lot of novelists writing today--they aren't saying anything. Plot takes a backseat to what Kudera is saying, though the plot isn't bad. It is difficult to peel back the layers of Kundera's point, but--as the title shows--he's commenting on identity: the identity we create for ourselves and the identity we create for others in our own mind. The novel raises more questions than it answers, but that's the sign of a great novel. Isn't it?
Example: [A TOTAL WASTE......] This product does not stand up against trying to cut grass, let alone any kind of weed!! Don't waste your time or money on these or the seller who would not make themselves available for any inquiry.
Example: [Bad Player & Bad Service] Out of the box the Rio 800 was a lemon. It crashed on half the songs I loaded, the battery showed full when it was almost empty and, best of all, the people at Rio don't exactly respond quickly to requests for repair or exchange. The unit is sitting in a drawer while I wait for their Customer diService department to get back to me. Maybe I'm too impatient, after all, I emailed them barely a month ago.
Example: [it works!] We bought this product six years ago.............the Mazda MX5 vinyl top still looks new, and has kept its flexibility........yes, we garage it, and treat it like the classic it is.......recently renewed our supply thru Amazon.............same product, same ease of application. I love it when products do exactly as advertised!
Example: [Waste of time] I agree with all the negative things other reviewers have said about this book...interesting premise not executed well. A bunch of women who have nothing better to do but hang out in a knitting shop all day? Please. A white man who discovers that his grandfather was black and now must deal with the fact that he is an "African American"? Again, please. And the baby in question, of course, is fantastically beautiful with "golden" eyelids, etc. The people are one-dimensional and there are too many plot lines that are left hanging at the end. A really good novel about this topic would have been a treat. This is a throwaway beach read at best.
Example: [Let's Be Honest] This book has a religious orientation that is not revealed until you open it and start reading. I have no objections to religion for those who choose it, however, I resent the "hidden agenda" aspect of this book. If I had known in advance this was a religion-based book, I would not have bought it. I think that's the idea behind their keeping quiet about it.
Example: [There should be a "0 star" rating...] Regardless of your political views, this is a poorly thought out excuse for a film. Anyone with more than a room temperature IQ will quickly be disgusted by the filmmaker's pandering and patronizing.
Example: [NOT SO GREAT] This game is very difficult to play . has alot of gliches, you have to keep buying food and water to feed your dog, well before you know it its all gone and you have to go to the pet store again, I tried to help my granddaughter get the dog to do tricks and its literally impossible, all it will do is sit. I can not make it do anything else I have tried everything and I am 49 years old, so how can a child be expected to learn the dog tricks. I still can't figure out how it is suppose to get sleep zzzz, or get him to go in the dog house. The game is frustrating for any child.
Example: [Worse harlequin I've ever read] I really don't understand the 5 star reviews. Normally, I try to keep an open mind to others' likes/dislikes, but this is one case where I am completely baffled that anyone would like this.There is NO chemistry at all between any of the characters. He threatens her no less than 4 times by saying either "if you were a man, I'd hit you" or "I'll kill you". Normally when the H/H get 'busy' any semi-reluctance has long since been banished, it almost feels like he assaults her in this story.I just can't stress how horrible this book is.
Example: [Good for only a year give or take...] Well I loved this Fm radio adaptor for my nano but it's been almost a year and it started acting a bit funky till the next day it just stopped working completely. So if I were you, do not waste 45-50 dollars on this merchandise if it's not going to last. I love apple but the fact that they didn't want to give me another one makes me not want to buy there product. The reason they ask for more money for a 2 year guarantee is because their products will eventually stop working. THIS IS JUST A WARNING:)
Example: [It kind of sucks!!!] I see my first review wasn't posted, maybe I was too mean. So I'll just say for a British House music lover, this CD & the import is a let down. But check out the remixes that are out there......
Example: [Pretty Cool!] It's amazing that there are so many private stuff in this books. I think children should know about sex at a young age because it will happen to them when they get older, like age 8. Go books!
Example: [love these!] These sort of hurt a first but after a few wears they are easy to use. I wear them to sleep sometimes. I think they have helped to mitigate bunion formation in my right great toe. I also use them when I do my own pedicures. I'm glad I bought these as they are durable and effective and non invasive.
Example: [clearjel starch] this starch is easy to use and the batches of canned peach pie filling were beautiful. will get more next year.
Example: [Tired] Having lost faith and taken a skeptical approach to religion I was hopeful that this book would lead me into rethink.No way! Tired and inaccurate, not a waste of time though as I found myself constanly jumping up with "That's not true." "What a jump!" and that's a downright fabrication!"
Example: [Powell rocks..] I think Palmer was still drumming with Asia when they made this one, which explains the different drummer. Everything else you might expect is as close to pure ELP as you can get. "The Score" has Emerson's grand, energy-packed keyboard playing a la "Brain Salad Surgery." "Touch and Go" leans toward the tone of "Black Moon." This whole album is not quite their '70s sound or their '90s sound, but somewhere in between. Some songs capture the best of both, such as "Learning to Fly." If ELP hadn't broken up in 1979, this is what some of their 80s stuff might have sounded like.
Example: [Christmas present] Bought this for my son who just purchased a mandolin. Had to let him open it early to use for some special music at church. He said it made it so much easier to play. Looks nice too.
Example: [Oy! Not What I expected] What can I say....I love Kodo. But this was not Kodo. While I'm sure the remixer's, DJ's, Et`al, might have meant well...What they did to this album is a grave injustice to Kodo. The tracks were so remixed, distorted, folded, bent, stapled, and mutilated. That I thought the Postal Service had gone into the Music Recording Industry to supplement their profits... I couldn't tell if most of the tracks were based on Kodo's works or not for the most part... Next time Kodo allows remixers to use their works. They should definitely put it in the contract someplace. That the tracks should at least resemble their original compositions in a more identifiable fashion. I love techno as much as the next person, but this was even beyond my tolerance...Guess I'm just a purest at heart, when it comes to Kodo and their style of Tiako.
Example: ["after fight club, the volume gets tuned down(...)"] ...Well, the same could be said of Mr Palahniuk's inspiration lately.Here is a compilation of his writing which reads more like articles than essays : demolition, castles, marilyn manson, hollywood, ghosts, etc... it's more of a bazaar. Gonzo journalism somehow...I skipped a lot of chapters just like i pick the juicy parts in my newspaper.I enjoy very much Mr Palahniuk novels, but it's not because you have talent and you sell, that you must publish everything you write.If you're a fan, you'll buy it anyway.Otherwise, wait until it's in paperback or get it at your local library. The price is defenitly not worth it. His Portland, Oregon guide is at least much more fun to read.
Example: [Whatever!!!!] The contents of this book are extremely offensive. I'm a muslim and from my point of view this book is biased. Lewis generalizes way too much. Sure there are some muslim extremist but what religion doesn't come with it's share of bad apples? If Islam is so "evil" and whatnot then how come even today you find old churches from way back in muslim countries yet in christian or jewish countries you only find ruins of what was once mosques? It's because Islam is a tolerant religion, and always has been, that's why. Again, what religion doesn't come with it's share of fanatics?
Example: [Pretty good, but needs attention] The actual function w as great, I was putting together an amplifier, but the only problem I had was that the pins came out after a little tug. This tug wasn't that bad either, I had soldered wires to pins 1-6 and I pulled on pin 3 not vary hard(maybe at 5 lbs of force) and it just slipped right out. Not the best thing after some extensive solder work but good thing I got more than one. Good price and functionality is superb.
Example: [One of the Best Books of all Time] This book is a masterpiece of Truth and Light. You cannot put a price on it! God bless you M. for so faithfully capturing the words of a Master. I only have to read a few pages and I find myself so uplifted and blown away by the simplicity and depth with which eternal truths are captured. An essential book for those who are on the Path.
Example: [Weak in comparison...] The only valuable part of this book was the list of Japanese terminology in traditional Ju Jitsu, plus a decent history section. Overall, though, the number of moves they offer is miniscule compared to other books on the market, and the pictures are so infrequent that, in a photo sequence, I often had no idea how the person got from their position in Photo 1 to their position in Photo 2. It's actually pretty funny. You'll have some guy doing something -- and, next picture, they're in an entirely different position. With the recent spate of Ju Jitsu and BJJ books, this is very outdated and I think would serve only as a broad introduction (like an extended Encyclopedia article).
Example: [Just a fun movie] Sit back and enjoy this version of Holmes. They could be a little more clever and a little less high tech but the acting is first rate and maybe they can evolve into the head game masters that Holmes and Watson are in other iterations.
Example: [King of Hearts DVD] Movie itself is great. It was sent as a gift to friend in London who couldn't view it. Did I miss the zone information? and it came with no cover, only a sleeve. all in all the first unsuccessful purchase. alas
Example: [The deodorant had a nice scent and worked ...] The deodorant had a nice scent and worked well in keeping me dry. Even after a day, I could feel that it was still on me. I would recommend it to someone because it's a good product.
Example: [these guys are horrible and pretentious] I work for a radio station. These guys were all the rage a few years ago, so I was sent out to a concert to get the inside scoop. I hated the show. The guy is talentless: he can neither sing nor play the guitar. The lyrics are strained and mock-absurdist. The guy is visibly aching for attention--"Don't you people think I'm weird?" When I interviewed them after the show I felt like pissing the whole time so I was extra-irritated by things I would normally overlook--i.e., the guy kept scratching his hair like some eccentric and I was on the verge of spitting in his face. So, lucky me: I was asked to review this album by the station. . . you can imagine the long harangue I launched against this godawful band. But nobody seems to mind me.
Example: [sucked, actually] a bitter disappointment. like getting coal for christmas. the plot was flatter than the DVD itself, and the characters were cliches with british accents.
Example: [Far too big...] I ordered these hoping that I'd have some great new silk pajamas to replace mine that had worn out. Let me tell you, if you're a small person like I am these are not at all for you. You will be completely drowning in them. I looked like I was 5 years old and playing dress up in my mother's clothing; the small is not at all small... I was highly disappointed.
Example: [Perfect! Get ready for your Fantasy to unfold] I'm Britney's #1 fan, a guy, and not gay. But I still bought Fantasy and Curious because I get everything she puts out. This really is VERY sexy smelling and I plan on buying it for my girlfriend someday. It smells like a forest, then cupcakes, musk, and is extremely sexy. Girls: buy this and your boyfriends will love you. I was in a lunch line and I smelled the girl next to me wearing it's distinct scent. I was drawn to her. Get my drift? It works! Buy it!
Example: [Familiar format for seniors] I purchased this book for my senior parents who have in the past year bought not one, but two new computers. Brave as they are, computer jargon is new to them, and sometimes I am hard pressed to help them out long distance. It was great to find this book that looks SO MUCH like the red Reader's Digest Do-It-Yourself book that has occupied my father's bookshelves for as long as I can remember. That familiarity is bound to feel something like climbing a new mountain in a pair of comfortable old jeans.
Example: [Great product] This is a fantastic tool. Easy to use, and does cut down on shedding. A little pricey, but I believe it's worth it.
Example: [Gm blower motor] Hey this was a good buy! It was cheaper than auto zone, shipped free, was simple to install! Best part is that it works perfect!!!!!
Example: [The Codpiece of Doom] The blu-ray is kind of unnecessary, as the film stock used to shoot the movie is not digital film, but the features were fun, the movie is a classic... and it's cheaper on blu-ray than on DVD... so what are you waiting for? BUY THE MOVIE! :)
Example: [Upstate New Yorker] All her books are great reading!This one is really good!Would buy againWill definitely buy more!
Example: [Poor and disapointing] Typically for the British:1. Lack of objectivity2. Lack of humility3. Eagerness to blame the foreigners4. The nationalistic bias5. FEEL-GOOD atmosphere
Example: [A fair book] +AH4-This book is unusual. It's very boring at some parts (I fell asleep reading this book). There's only a few exciting parts but they wear off fast. You should try reading his better books first.+AH4-
Example: [Hobb is Burnt Out] After reading the 1st two books in Robin Hobb's Farseer Trilogy and enjoying them immensely, I was more than just a little disappointed in the 3rd volume. Hobb appears to have burnt out. He devotes pages and pages to boring pointless journeys, opens a promising theme - Old Blood - and never develops it and his evil king character develops a split personality, alternatly swinging from evil genius to drug addeled dilettante. I finished the book but it was so poorly done I had a real hard time not just chucking it part way thru.
Example: [Terrible PRODUCT-Whats going on with SONY DVD players] ALL current HDMI Upscale DVD players on the market are FIRST generation products and are all in need of work. However I cannot afford to waste money or time until they get it right. The HDMI connects looked great...it stopped working within 48 hours. So then I was left with only the progressive outlets working till I worked on returning this item. Then I noticed that the progressive connects (yeah they worked) but looked HORRIBLE. So I went back to my old sony 425P. I love this player and in my opinion is one of the GREAT dvd players sony has made 2+yrs and running strong.So please avoid this player read the rest of the reviews and wait for awhile till they submit a new model with HDMI connects
Example: [Good Ideas, Bad Writing] Reading through the table of contents shows a wide variety of prayers on topics from Prayer to the Dawn to Prayer to Save the Rain Forests. Unfortunately, the prayers themselves are dry and contrite. They state the spirtual need in a matter of fact, textbook way. No sense of artistic flow. For the Star Trek fans out there a good example of a poem Data might write.
Example: [Not the same as Ghiradelli] They are now made by a different company, TJerrild, located in Fresno, CA. They definitely do not taste the same as Ghiradelli. Supposedly they are made with the same ingredients, but I would say not the same recipe. A huge difference in taste form when I was a kid. Thanks for the memories Ghiradelli....
Example: [Important stuff but hard slogging] This is an encyclopedia, and reading such things is not what most people, even when deeply interested in the subject are likely to do. It does provide a fair reference for specific topics, but this is not a subject one can really pick and choose.VAR is the ususal starting point, and its famous authors (one of whom I hired for his skill in these matters) cover most of the bases in an interesting way.
Example: [Unless you love Zeppelin, there may be a better album foryou] I love this album.However, if you're looking for 'The Best of Zeppelin', look at 2, 3, 4/Runes, or Houses of the Holy. In fact, buy those first, this next, then Presence. The main attraction of this album for me is the song Kashmir, which made the purchase more than worth it.
Example: [A real letdown] I have all the Zen Garden recordings and this one is a total letdown. Do not buy this CD because it does not live up to the standards of previous Zen Garden albums. I use this music to help me sleep (due to chronic insomnia) so I am not asking for more than capably produced, relaxing sounds. This CD is just awful. Get Restful Earth instead, it is a much better disc.
Example: [If you want to be a better friend, read this book!] If you are looking to be a better friend to your closest friends, I highly recommend this book!
Example: [Useful at first, but not for long] We bought these books to teach us come finer aspects of Visual Test, and they do just that -- to an extent. Unfortunately, after the first several chapters, it quickly becomes useless, barely covering some very important aspects of the product (file I/O, pointers), and spending entirely too much time explaining how to test Wordpad. I would rather have a good reference for this product than this.It seemed a little half-baked. It was good in some areas, but for the most part lost usefulness quickly. I can't in good conscience give this any more than a mediocre review.
Example: [rainbow popsicles and diamond-paved streets] Music to go on a picnic to, or drive around to on a sunny day with someone you like a lot. Cub makes me feel cheery. . and wistfull. It's kind of like eating really good candy.
Example: [How do you get it to work?] I was really looking forward to seeing the art but I put the CD's in and nothing happened. At all! I knew it wasn't my computer and tried all of the CDs. What a disappointment. I returned it and hope to find something similar that works! Maybe I just got a bad set.
Example: [Flimsy Construction] The cylindrical housing around the lens is attached to the body in a very flimsy manner and comes out easily
Example: [Fifteen shades of manic fun!] I'll keep this short and sweet: I haven't had this much fun with a record in a VERY long time. I don't think they could've crammed any more influences into their sound if they wanted to. This CD is just sheer, unadulterated party music... "Kountry Genlteman" and "Luv Addict" are standouts, but there's not a yawner here! Put this in rotation at your next party and kick the good time up about two and a half notches!
Example: [Not worth it] Very disappointed with this pair of Apple Bottoms! I have several pairs and this one is not worth it. Neither the product description nor the pictures on the website give you a very close look at the jeans. Some of the "special details" make it seem as if the item were damaged. It doesn't look cool!
Example: [Bears in the Barn] I ordered this book for my granddaughter for christmas on Dec 3th and recieved it when I was informed of the shipping date. My granddaughter enjoyed this book very much. I had a very good experience with this company and would order again from Internationalbooks. Keep up the good service.
Example: [Ugh; not mysterious, thrilling, romantic or humurous--annoying and boring read] Ugh. This was the worst in the series by far; it was literally a chore to drag myself through the end. All the stuff about Eddie Kroll is just completely irrelevant and stupid and detracts from what's supposed to be the main story. Nina was also incredibly stupid and annoying, and as other reviewers have mentioned the killer was quite obvious and the resolution a mess. By the time I got to the end I was just finishing it to finish it and was completely unconcerned and uninvolved in what was happening. A terrible read; the first two (Cold Truth: A NovelandHard Truth: A Novel) are worth borrowing, but this one isn't even worth that. Lacks suspense, romance, mystery, humor--it doesn't have a single redeeming quality. Borrow the first two in the series, but this one isn't even worth that.
Example: [disappointing sound volume] I was surprised with the low volume level, especially after reading the reviews here. With the volume on my cell turned all the way up, the earpiece is still pretty quiet, and I even have trouble hearing some people at all. However, I am using the headset with an LG VX3300, which I suspect has a low powered external jack. But, even with a $10 inline Sony earpiece (with a regular earbud that doesn't go into the ear canal), the volume is higher. Also, people on the other end of the line hear me more clearly when I'm not using the headset.
Example: [Just Great!!!!!] I had been worked with VB a little before, then I got this book and it's....WOOOOAOAOAOAAAH! It gives a great base to the language, and something on its subset (VBScript/VBA/ASP).The book does get through a lot of things linked to the language, its components and things like that. However if someone wants to get 'professional' about a detail (eg: WinSock), one has to look elsewhere. This said, the background provided by this book makes understanding these 'extras' an easy thing.Having access to M$'s MSDN is an extra help (in this, and any M$ language/sytem), for refering to API's and 'hidden' details.
Example: [Non intuitive and full of bugs] After 3 days of intensive learning I still can't do some very basic things, it takes me sometimes hours of research to do the most simple things ... like gradient painting a circle object while it takes one intuitive action with my previous software to do that. I find Photoshop CS2 is too complexe in its structure, vocabulary and workflow philosophy for the occasional user. I reckon it takes at least 2 full weeks of training to manage this software, far too much in my opinion, I mean we're talking of image processing ... in comparaison it took me 1 week to manage Autocad and about 2 weeks for a FEA pro softaware.
Example: [WARNING TO PARENTS!!!] This series is intended for Ages 8 to 12 and this Book Two is TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE for this age group. There is graphic cruelty to animals which is even depicted in an illustration!!! The bad fairies catch a domestic cat and roast it on a spit! Children will either be traumatized or intrigued by it - both very BAD! There are too many good alternatives out there. Try these series: Chet Gecko Mysteries, Magic Tree House, Secrets of Droon, Animal Ark Series, A to Z Mysteries, Box Car Children, American Girl History Mysteries and the 3 Adventure series - Island, Dive, and Everest. Also books by Eva Ibbotson, Beverly Cleary, Judy Blume, George Selden, E.B. White, R. Dahl, Estes and Eager.
Example: [One of the best I have ever read!!!] Yoga for the New Millenniuma novel by Tamal Krishna GoswamiYoga for the New Millennium easily disposes of questions pondered by mankind for thousands of years. Travel with a young man on his journey of self - discovery and see how the timeless truths of the ancient yoga system are powerfully relevant today, at a time when humanity is seeking solutions to unprecedented problems.His Holiness Tamal Krishna Goswami is a world - renowned teacher and practitioner of yoga as presented in the ancient Vedas of India, such as The Bhagavad - gita. He has lectured internationally for over 30 years and his books have been translated into several languages.This soft bound book is 195 pages long. I personally couldn't put it down and feel that is is one of the most interesting and well written novels I have ever read. Fascinating, and intelligently done, I HIGHLY recommend this great book! Get it today!!
Example: [John's Recommendation] The Train is a very good movie that takes place during WW2. It portrays the Nazi's efforts to steal and ship the Art of France to Berlin by rail and how the French underground put a stop to it. A very good Movie.
Example: [Good book group material] I came upon this book inadvertently during some surfing on Amazon. I was intrigued by the reviews & ordered it. It is a wonderfully complex story that everyone in my book group praised. The author vividly presents the lives of the sandhoggers and masterfully interweaves the present day with the past.
Example: [Still the best energy modelling book] Good balance of intuition and technical details on modelling and pricing energy related derivatives. Very hands on discussion on the pros and cons of various approaches. Ideal for quants or quantitative traders with a good understanding of stochastic calculus and statistics.
Example: [Does not come with two extra wheels as it says it would] The product features says that the board comes with "Value Pack includes two extra wheels" however it does not.Product FeaturesGroundbreaking caster board that acts like a skateboard/snowboard hybridPivoting deck and 360-degree caster trucks enable snowboard-like carvingSpiked traction pads, kick tail and nose, and concave deck design76mm polyurethane wheels and precision ABEC-5 bearing casters; Value Pack includes two extra wheelsDesigned for riders age 8 years and up; supports up to 220 pounds
Example: [Fun...just fun to watch] This is a really creative idea--to make a period piece following the classic Lovecraft tale using the same film style that was present when the story was written. Just a brilliant move. I really like that this was made by members of the HP Lovecraft Historical Society as well. If you are a Lovecraft fan, and would like to see a film stylized to fit 1930's style of silent picture, get it. The art-deco Cthulu statue is a nice touch as well.
Example: [Fast and tight action story] Tight story telling and nerve breaking suspenseful action drama with solid performances!!One can see why Korean made movies are so popular in all over the Asian regions these days!!!
Example: [Battery dead in 5 months] Bought these for our sports team on December 6. Five months later the batteries are dead even though it is advertised with a 1.5 year battery life. Looks like they were manufactured in 2009. There is no tab to pull out to start the battery running the watch so it is running before you receive it. They take an LR43 Maxell battery and you have to remove 5 tiny screws to change the battery. I wouldn't buy it again. It does work properly, though, until it dies.
Example: [Not what was promised] I do not buy Library Discards.This book was supposed to be "like new" (even the sticker on the back cover says so) and said nothing about a library discard.The book is in poor cover condition, the pages are very yellow and it is most definitely a library discard.I will not be able to use it in our library so this was a total waste of money!I will not be purchasing from this seller again.
Example: [A great piece of history and musical history] One night I was going through my music of the 40's and re-discovered Jane Froman singing WITH A SONG IN MY HEART. After shedding my goosebumps I remembered that it came from an Academy Award movie in my young days. I did an online search and up it came. I didn't even dream it was still available. But Amazon had it. I ordered it because my very musical granddaughter has grown to love movie music and broadway. I would love to hear her sing this song. And what a great way for a young person to piece together some WWII history and showbiz history and radio history at the same time.Thank you Jane for your music and your commitment to the USA. Thank you Amazon for having it.Dick Pickensretired dj
Example: [perfect] I can't use a blade on my face, it irritates my skin. I've tried a lot of electric trimmers. this one by far is the closest shave I have ever had with an electric. it's tiny. it's not unreasonably loud like some other reviews say, it's an electric trimmer, they make noise, big deal. I only write reviews if something is awesome or awful. these trimmers are awesome. if it ever breaks, I'm buying the same one again.
Example: [BRING IT BACK ON DVD!] My sister and I used to watch this movie among all others when we were little. Not only did we love the Lyle Lyle Crocodile books, but when a friend of the family sent us a homemade copy on VHS of this animated version of The House on East 88th St, it quickly became a new favorite. Fortunately, I still have that tape in my attic, but my VCR has been in the landfill for years, since it's kaput. I want it not only for myself, but I have a friend who just had a kid, and they too will need a copy of this first-rate cartoon musical. PLEASE BRING IT BACK!
Example: [Pretty good workout!] I consider myself to be in good shape and I workout by either running 5 miles or DVD's such as Insanity/Bob Harper/Jillian Michael's 5-6 days a week. This DVD is fun and not as hard as those mentioned but works up a good sweat and I love how it is broken up into 10 min segments. I am definitely interested in trying more 10 min Solution DVD's to add to my rotation!
Example: [Good enough to please !] Finished this book in a day. OK it is not classic but it is fun read, with a plot exciting enough to keep me flipping the pages. I know this is fiction but Brown should have tried harder to get his facts right. I am an admirer of the great genius, Michelangelo and Brown has definitely erred in his reference to this great artist's works. First Michelangelo was not the architect of any stair case in the Vatican City. Second the Vatican does not possess any male nude sculpture by Michelangelo, with its stony penis removed . Dan's errors is irritating and a trifle irresposible. Still Angels & Demons is great entertainment and will not be my last book by this writer.
Example: [Did not last long] I had this unit for a little over one year. The refrigerant coil started leaking just after the warranty ran out. Had to junk it. Would not recommend.
Example: [Great tool] Excellent tool for learning the techniques and licks of this album, author should do a few other. Highly recommended.

Example: [Warning! Major errors in this title] I'm just wrapping up my National Boards, and have found several major errors is this book. (Sort of a surprise, considering the publishing company and the "New! Updated!" sales pitch.) One is where she comments she's "reluctant to share her own entries with her candidates." Sharing actual entries is against the code of ethics for trainers. On page 42 she references a 15 minute video tape for entry one. Nope, no video for that entry. I did use some of the other pieces, but not as many as some of the other books available.
Example: [The MXZ saw is a piece of junk] When I watched a demontration of this saw cutting through all different types of material like metal, glass and brick I was amazed and at such a great price. When I received it and tried to cut a small to medium sized branch I did not have the same success. It is like a butter knife more than a saw. After half an hour trying to cut this branch, I finally gave up. I must admit, I wish I had the saw they were showing on the TV advertisement. The one I have is definitely not it. This is a piece of junk. I only wish I could get my money back. Best I can tell, it won't cut through anything.
Example: [AS EXPLOSIVE AS THE SNEEZE OF A SQUIRREL] When I was watching this movie, I found myself going through a mental list of what I needed to do the next day, what we were going to have for breakfast the next morning and hoping this movie would end soon. Wesley Snipes is about exciting as watching the rinse cycle on a washing machine, the plot is so convoluted and incoherent, and the action sequences look like they came out of a movie catalogue. Ho hum, indeed.
Example: [This is a very good item,a very good tool to use.] This is a good book to read, relearn and this is a good price to buy.This is a very good item,a very good tool to use.This is a very good item,a very good tool to use.This is a very good item,a very good tool to use.This is a very good item,a very good tool to use.This is a very good item,a very good tool to use.This is a very good item,a very good tool to use.This is a very good item,a very good tool to use.This is a very good item,a very good tool to use.This is a very good item,a very good tool to use.This is a very good item,a very good tool to use.This is a very good item,a very good tool to use.
Example: [Don't Bother] I thought this movie was awful. I like Jennifer Aniston, but the story stunk, the characters were seedy. ick. Don't Bother.
Example: [Great watch] This is a replacement for an Ironman - great watch with many functions. Really can't believe they can pack this much into it for the price.
Example: [Not only DID NOTwork...] I installed it and immediately had issues reconnecting an Ethernet bridge to my wireless router. I was also unable to login to work over a VPN connection after the install. I had to uninstall the software in order to connect things back up.The documentation was beyond my understanding.
Example: [the runner] I thought the runner was an alright novel. Cynthia Voigt is a good author but this book was hard for me to understand. Due to the fact that you have to be in bullets position. I personally can not put my self in his position so I was confused. But even though it confused me she did a good job writng it. It is a book for people that can put themselves in oter peoples position. If there is any body that can do that than I would highly suggest to read this book.
Example: [Dehydrator] Overall seems to be a good product. Like the temperature control and the ability to add trays. My husband uses it for drying morels and I can't wait to try it with my strawberry's in a couple weeks.
Example: [disappointing battery life] Needed another replacement battery for my aging iBook G4 and took a chance, as the price was definitely right. However, the lifespan of this battery has left a lot to be desired. Within the first two months, the battery was fine, but it just never seemed to work correctly - the charging indicator would always indicate "charging" even afer I knew the battery should have been fully charged. By 6 months out, the battery would only hold a charge for about 20 minutes. By now - less than one year - the battery holds about a 9 minute charge and gives no warning at all before just dying out. The Mac is still a good machine and I will need yet another battery, but I can't say it will be one of these Tech Orbit batteries.
Example: [NOT Recommended for Quick Conversational Learning] With an upcoming trip to Spain, and no knowledge whatsoever of Spanish, I ordered this set hoping to learn enough Spanish to get by.The first sixty or so lessons were isolated repetitions of lists of words with no contextual phrasing or conversation whatsoever. My knowledge of French and Italian helped with those Spanish words that have similarities in those other languages, but otherwise, by the time I got to subsequent lessons, it was almost impossible for me to recall the bulk of the Spanish words dictated in the earlier lessons.My wife, who took Spanish in school, found the lessons to be good refreshers, but also agreed that they did not serve well as a pre-vacation immersion course.Anyone wishing to quickly learn conversational Spanish should ignore the glowing reviews below and consider obtaining a course that uses the immersion method (i.e. where you listen to everything IN CONTEXT rather than in isolated dictate-pause-dictate list fashion).
Example: [Throbbing Epistles!] This is probably the most listenable of the TG albums that I have yet to hear. "What a Day" is clearly one of the highlights of this album, mainly because it features an excellent sample of an inmate at some penitentiary talking to adolescents about the rigors of prison life (a la Scared Straight). "Leeds Ripper" is also a perennial favorite as is the first track on the album and "Her Arm Was Her Leg". Whatever anybody has to say about TG in terms of musical ability/talent will always sound a bit presumptuous to me (especially if the criticism happens to be negative or derogatory). TG seems to have been first and foremost conceptual art/cultural terrorism interested in exploring/exploiting conventions and cultural mores in an attempt to discover what lies beyond the frontiers of acceptability. Music just happened to figure into the equation as a means of achieving specific ends. Well, if you're interested in the TG sound I would recommend this album and also Dimensia in Excelsis.
Example: [Way above and beyond what you need to know!] Sorry I bought the book. I could not even use this book. After reading the Todd Lammle books from Sybex and the CCNA Exam Cert Guide from Cisco Press, I started looking at these questions... Wow! where did they get this stuff... It was scary! CCNA is suppost to be a basic certification. These questions were written for gurus (and some of them may have trouble). If you like shock therapy, then this book is for you.
Example: [Not what I expected.] This is one of the times that I am really kicking myself for not getting the sample. Is this really considered a book? There's not a bit of storyline here. I really loved the Carrie Diaries and came into this book with expectations maybe a little higher than it deserved. Okay, a lot.
Example: [nice but short] I had been looking to replace my OXO Good Grips flexible Spatula that I gave to my mother in law. Though I found that same one, I went with this cheaper option. With shipping it ended up being about the same and I wish I had brought the original version. The blade on this one seems very sharp - not the case in my old OXO. It does the job, but I was able to use my old one on a nonstick frying pan to flip for over easy eggs without any issues. With the sharp edge I believe this one will scratch up my pan. I say pay the extra $3 or 4 and get the OXO one. This is also much shorter that the other one and I didnt pay attention to any details about length. Not meant for someone with big hands.
Example: [Terrible synthpop with even worse vocals!] A warning for the wise: Do NOT waste your money on this CD. The instrumentals are mediocre at best. Extremely generic. And the vocals are just plain terrible. Mr. Miller sounds extremely amateurish on the recordings, and if Rui wants to salvage the band, he would do well to find a new singer. Carol Masters' EP is truly disappointing.
Example: [WOKA-WOKA!] Owning this wok has changed my eating habits. I now enjoy a much healthier diet and it's fun to use. I've tried a few different woks and this one stands out. Its great heat dissipation cooks fast and evenly and although Circulon's ribbed, non-stick surface is not found on traditional woks, it works as well here as on their skillets and pots. A perfect marriage of new technology and old!
Example: [This is what Maiden should have evolved into.] After hearing this c.d., it's obvious that Bruce didn't have as much say into the direction of Iron Maiden as he should have. (No offense to Steve Harris). This c.d. has added elements and color that Iron Maiden NEVER had - an all accoustic song, a REALLY heavy rhythm section, and an even mix of the instruments! Don't get me wrong, I love Maiden up through Seventh Son, but Mr. Harris can be a little narrow minded. His over-mixed bass playing tends to take away from the heaviness of the riffs. (Imagine driving a fast car over a bunch of speed bumps).As for Accident of Birth, I really can't pinpoint the standout songs, 'cause they all stand out. Roy Z does a remarkable job! I saw this tour when I was in Minnesota, and it's a real shame that they were playing in small bars and clubs. This c.d. is one of the highlights of the '90s!
Example: [What a great product!! So many episodes!] Really like Poirot and this made my collection! There are so many episodes of Poirot. It took my wife and I a month to watch one a day, which was our goal and something to look forward to each day. Plus there are so many that we can see them again without having to watch the same ones over and over. David Suchet does a great job in these!
Example: [This is getting interesting] The review from Stephen Nichols reads exactly the same as the one by Linda Tanner Nichols which appeared the day the book was published but presumably pulled recently. What's going on?
Example: [WELL DONE BUT KINDA OBVIOUS] THE PORNOGRAPHER (Koch Lorber) is Betrand Bonello's explicit and controversial portrait of Jacques, a once famous and acclaimed -- but now burned out -- 50 year old pornographer from the 70s who tries to get back in the business of erotic films for the bucks.However, he soon sadly discovers that he has lost his passion personally and professionally and must examine his own life and the trajectory that has brought him to this place. Jacques descends into a lonely isolation as he disconnects with his son, two ex-wives and finally himself.Be warned, there's brief but very explicit sex.
Example: [A Useful Book] This book is very useful in studying the meanings of planets in signs and houses. It is simple, easy to use, and written in easy to understand English.
Example: [Banjo with Eddie Adcock] Must be a good player to understand what he is doing. Not good for beginers.
Example: [Clancy's best fictional work] This novel represents the best of what Tom Clancy has to offer: exciting, fairly clever plot filled with intrigue and suspense. As with others of Clancy's early books, he leaves out female characters (which he is completely inept at portraying in any event) and does a good job of getting us to root for Jack Ryan at the turn of every page. Very readable.
Example: [This book is all you need for SCWCD Exam.] If you are preparing for the SCWCD(J2EE 1.4) Exam, then this book is all you need. Note that this book teaches you more than what you need to know for the exam. And as always, you need to practice writing a lot of code yourself.Even though I didn't have much experience with J2EE, I scored 89% by reading this book and practicing a lot of code. Also, don't forget to visit javaranch.com before the exam.
Example: [It's not all perfect...] To me, this book teaches Visual Basic 6 in a friendly manner, but it lacks explanation in some areas. Even though, it still is able to teach programming farely well.Watch out! This book does contain flaws in code. I encourage you to buy a little reference book so you are able to point out and debug the wrong code.This book isn't a newbies dream come true, but it is a decently good Visual Basic 6 book.
Example: [Dreadful!] This must be the most overrated movie in cinema history. A depressed boring has-been actor meets a depressed boring unhappy young wife and they do unmemorable things in Japan. The screen chemistry between the main characters is about the same as between a brick and a bar of soap. Bill Murray acts like he is pumped with Thorazine.This is truly one of the dullest, worst movies that I have ever seen. I literally had to keep waking myself up to keep watching it.The Emperor truly has no clothes. Sofia Coppola should get a job as a manicurist in Long Island.
Example: [Norton Password Manager 2004] I recently purchased the cd-rom of Norton Password Manager 2004And it does exactly what is says it will do!!!!!!!!!!!
Example: [Great Book] This book brings out the major steps and who was responsible for them from the time of Hippocrates forward. It is interesting and contains a review at the end of each chapter. The best part is that it holds the kids' interest, it isn't just a dry book filled with information. We are enjoying this book in our homeschool this year. Though it is written from a Christian perspective and does bring forth information about the faith of the men/women involved, it is not overly religious. For people of the Christian faith, it points out how faith influenced the people who are discussed, but the history is sound, and provides a good background in those major developments of medical history whether or not you believe in Christianity.
Example: [Incredibly hard to clean] I love that this travel mug is airtight, keeps my tea piping hot and my cold drinks super cold for hours. It's also spill proof in the car and easy to drink while driving.However, as another reviewer mentioned, it's incredible hard to clean this mug. I used this mug at first for my coffee every morning and I always use half and half. I would rinse and wash it out every day like I normally do with travel mugs. After a month, I noticed a strange odor coming from the lid. Upon further inspection and cleaning, I too noticed that there was a lot of crud trapped in the lid mechanism. I ended up cleaning it with a combination of steaming hot tap water, q-tips, and dish detergent. It took me about a half an hour to get everything out. But who has the time to do this every day?Now I limit its use to plain tea and cold drinks. This is disappointing to me because this mug is pricey as far as travel mugs go.
Example: [This offer is a joke...I only gave it 1 star because they forced me to] This should be a zero star rating!If you are looking for the entire Final Four...you will not find it here.As a Kansas alum, fan, and native Kansan...this DVD bothers me greatly. I would guess that many fans will want the full national semi-final game just as much as the championship game, but you will not get it here. The KU vs. UNC game has random cuts in the action. I was lucky enough to see a replay before the national title game, but I would prefer to own that UNC stomping in its entirety.I just do not understand why the NCAA cannot get it right. The best DVD set I have purchased was the 2004 Red Sox set. I would happily pay extra to get all the Kansas tourney games, but I guess this is the best you can hope for this year. The sad thing is that the bare bones 1988 KU DVD that is two separate DVDs is even better than this one.
Example: [What did I just say?] This book has changed my life, it has given the spoken language new clarity from the eyes of the young. I now have control of how words are spoken, interperted and understood, before I always assumed my child understood what I meant. My children have responded very well to this easy to follow and understand guide. We have also been fortunate enough to be in therapy with Dr. Donovan for the past 1 1/2, as we live in St Petersburg, Fl. Read the book, absorb the book, implement the book and change your world and your childs.
Example: [The lucky one] Zac Efrom is all grown up ! This Is his best film , yet !!! , He can sing , he can dance & he can act , he's one of the few young actor's of this generation , I can see an Oscar , an Emmy , a Tony & a Grammy ( or Many of them in his future ) ZAC EFROM IS THE BEST !!!
Example: [Great looking solid wood - poster frame!] I had so much trouble finding a decent 11"X 17" frame. This fame is a solid quality frame, I plan to purchase other sizes in the future.
Example: [Cheesy and so painful to read] i had no idea this was an old book either. shame on either amazon or the publishers for not stating that somewhere. I was convinced Harlen Coben did not write it and forced myself to read the whole thing. The story is cheesy and the dialogue even cheesier. what a waste of time.
Example: [DON'T DO THE TWIST] Twister is a bad movie with a horrible horrible plot that adds up to nothing. It's about a couple of tornado chasers that fall in love. Ever so dumb plot. The only thing that makes me give this movie two whole stars is the special effects (although the movie deserves only one). Special effects are great in this movie. If your a no plot special effects freak (buff), then you would love this horrible movie Twister. Rated PG-13: for language, and scenes of tornado damage
Example: [Cute, but not practical] These old mechanical speedometers were fun and they still are fun, but that is about all.These are the right thing for a classic bike from the 1960's or 1970's that is being restored and needs some authentic repop after-market glitz.The length of the cable is fork-length specific, however. Too long or too short and they won't work. The cable is a mechanical metal stick that is driven by the wheel and turns inside the cable housing to drive the mechanical clock inside the speedometer. It needs a pretty straight shot from the front fork dropouts to the mounting on the handlebar.These old things were fun as kids. They didn't last very long then and they don't last very long now either from a functionality standpoint. If you want it for cool factor on an old bike, this is the thing, surely. However, if you really plan to use it, get yourself a modern electronic cyclocomputer.
Example: [Veer-Zaara] After first seeing the last half this on SBS (Australian Govt. Funded TV) late one evening I was amazed at how fun The Bollywood Genre was.Looked the film up on the Web and found out that it was one of the most successful Bollywood films ever.The story in itself lends itself to fall into the "Chick Flick" category. A story of forbidden love, and the sacrifices people are willing to make...Brilliantly put together film, by far my favorite scene is the Festival of Lodi, brilliant dance, costumes and song... you just can't help but smile and enjoy it!
Example: [hard] We have a colgate foam mattress for our oldest daughter that we got at buy buy baby, we love it. Then to save some money I found this one on amazon. And I'm really bummed out about it. Our one from buy buy baby is two sided, one side is for NB's then you flip it when the baby is 1 years old for a softer mattress. So when I ordered this one I thought it would be just like that. But its SO hard and its not double sided. We're using it for now, but I'm going to have to get something different our 4 month old just tosses all night in it, I feel like shes sleeping on concrete!
Example: [Disappointed] I was very disappointed in the Red Oster Toaster Oven. When I put it on my counter, with the cabinets above, it did not look at all red; it looked black. The cord touched the back a little and it got really hot, and put out a smell that lasted one hour after it was unplugged, before it went away. The toaster has no setting so you have to just guess. I sent it back for a refund.
Example: [Better than Thought] You know I remember seeing the previews on tv for the movie and all I can think of is how that would probably one of the DUMBEST movies I have ever seen made. Once I saw it, my mouth stays shut, but not during the movie. I was laughing the WHOLE time! It was very amusing. It was worth watching it. And, I would watch it again.
Example: [Better Than Average] I loved the whole "ghost" story approach. Muffled crying in the night when no one is there. The mist. The cliff. The ghostly appearances. One would never guess until the end what is going on! The only problem I had was a 40 year old man pursuing a 20 year old girl. Call me old fashioned! But, you won't be dissappointed with this one. Although there are some "dead" scenes now and again (pardon the pun), all in all, a keeper.
Example: [No sophomore slump here] Side 1 - RockFunk #49- funky greasey rockAsshton Park- Echoplex demonstrationWoman- Good basslineBomber: Closet Queen/Bolero/Cast Your Fate-My copy is missing "bolero", but it's still A+Side 2 - Perfect head musicTend My Garden- Ode for those who were growing your own?The acoustic suite parts 1-31. There I Go Again-2. Thanks3. Ashes the Rain and I
Example: [THE OZZMAN DID IT AGAIN] Put the best songs ozzy has ever made alone together, add some black sabbath and you'll get one of the best osbourne cds EVER CREATED
Example: [Best TV series EVER] Season 1, 2, 3, WHERE'S 4, 5, 6, 7? In my opinion THE BEST TV SERIES EVER. TERRIFIC CHARACTERS and great plots. Love stories, adventure, and SCIFI. Like they were my family and this was my hometown, and I'M AN OLD GEEZER. Really amazes me what programs are retained for years and this was let go after 3. It should have been promoted more as most people never heard of it.
Example: [The new Garmn Quest Suction Cup holder is awesome] The new Garmin Quest Suction Cup holder is awesome. I have now the flexibility to put it everywere not possible with the old one. Definitely it is worth every penny. I highly recommend this device.
Example: [Excellent and from the Boris Karloff era] This movie brings back the scarry movie themes from the past. The mummy is a creature of passion and horror and the supernatural that we all wish we will not run into. We need to believe in something supernatural and the mummy captures todays tenology and yesterdays myths. Forget all your preconceived ideas and enjoy the movie.
Example: [If you need something to inspire the holiday spirit ...] If you need something to inspire the spirit of the holiday in your soul,this is the only CD you need to even think about!! Celine Dion captures the magic and the mystery of Christmas as only she can! Her version of Ava Maria is absolutely phenomenal! Who else would consider Brahm's lullaby on a Christmas CD? What a terrific gift she has given all of us!
Example: [Don't Waste Your Money!] Don't bother buying this! I bought it yesterday and it does NOT work. You have to bang the wheels into walls or furniture (rather HARD) for the music to play. It's supposed to go as baby walks or spins the middle circle. Nope. Another disappointment from fisher-price. It's too light - our 8 month old daughter tried walking with it and it went too quickly for her and she fell. Bad design.
Example: [Lovely Earrings] These earrings were exactly as represented. They look lovely on and I have received many favorable comments.
Example: [Excellent] I have read all but the last 2 books in this series (and those are sitting on my shelf), and ever single entry is excellent and intelligently written. Cuddy is honorable, tough and smart (although a bit too sanctimonious) and the other characters are always vivid and believable. The mystery here is first-rate; I was shaking my head in amazement after all the pieces came together. Healy deserves to be a lot better known and successful.
Example: [Bulldogs - This is for you!] I don't normally leave feedback but was so pleased with this product I decided to share it with other short haired dog owners. I have an American Bulldog who SHEDS EVERYWHERE. He shakes, fur flies! He loves this comb when I brush him outside, it left a pile of hair on the sidewalk. His coat is even shinier. The only problem I have now is that when it is time to go outside, he stares at the comb (I keep it by the door), so I'm obligated to brush him very often! Seriously, though, it cuts WAY down on the shedding hair.
Example: [Belkin Pre-N Desktop Card Review] Works very well with the Belkin router. Signal strength is far better than my previous Linksys router as well (router is on top floor of house and desktop is in the basement). As with previous posts, disregard the instructions to install with the label face-up. They are wrong - it goes in face down.
Example: [This vacuum sucks...dirt!] This vacuum is wonderful! I had another, smaller "pet" brand vacuum that promised to suck up all of the pet hair I had. Well after having it for less than a year it broke, and I began my search for a vacuum that actually worked that didn't break my bank. The price of this vacuum is what caught my eye first. It was around $50 which was in my price range for a vacuum. I got it home and it was very easy to put together. I was so surprised when I turned it on and vacuumed a small area in my bedroom! So much dust, and pet fur that I hadn't seen. I was able to go over that spot a few more times and pick up even more. This bissell has a powerful suck that gets ingrained dirt out. I also like the attachable parts that comes with this vacuum. I have been able to use those on my couch to pick up extra pet fur, and in the nook and crannies of the house. It is a bit noisey and can get pretty dusty but on the whole this a great vacuum for the price!
Example: [Don't waste an hour and a half of your life.] This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. You'll spend the entire movie asking what the heck the characters are doing, both because their actions make no sense and also since you will have figured out the plot sequence ages in advance. That extends to the conclusion, as well. Needless and obvious detours are taken in what I guess is an attempt to make this longer than the 30 minutes the story may deserve. The camera bounces from one angle to the next, serving to both confuse and distract from the already sucktacular scenes. Trust me, you'll walk away disgusted in the fact that you can't get the time you spent watching this movie back.
Example: [FALSE TEACHER] Do NOT waste your money on ANYTHING this author has written. He is not a Believer, He is not Jewish, He is not Christian, He is not even a good liar.
Example: [If I Never Knew You] Very disappointed they once again cut "If I Never Knew You." Who cares that it's included in the supplements! The fact that it's not in the actual film is so frustrating and ridiculous. Why are the people at Disney so clueless???
Example: [It's a rip off] It came, but is teeny tiny little cheap thing. Don't waste your money on this. Hardly even a stocking stuffer.
Example: [must have for lavender lovers] The best lavender cookbook around. They shipped fast and the condition was first rate. A must have for cooks.
Example: [Not worth the money] You get what you pay for. I bought them because they were less expensive than I have seen them elsewhere. I didn't take them out of the box for a few months and found that there was paint missing and one of the legs to hold it in place was missing. I kept them since they were going in the very back of my yard where hardly anyone would see them
Example: [great fun] This is a world gone by but fun to read the mystery. I did figure it out quite early, though. Well written and the characters are fun. He really is a fun writer to read.
Example: [Great at first, but has problems with chipping] We got these mugs for everyday use around the house (we're trying to reduce the amount of plastic our children drink from) but within a few weeks of regular use, the enamel started chipping off. We ended up having to throw them all away.
Example: [The worst] Don't believe the hype surrounding these bottles. Everyone told us that these were the best, etc.... Well, they're not. They leak everywhere (despite using the fix outlined on the package) and their low flow nipples only work if you have an hour to spare for each feed. We have had much better luck with the basic nipple/bottle set ups from Gerber or Playtex.
Example: [Doesn't work with Vista, however plug and play in Linux (Fedora 9).] I could never get the Vista driver to install properly. The one on the CD didn't work, the one on their website didn't either. The Realtek driver that installed itself automatically made my machine unstable. I called tech support and the lady hardly paid attention to my problem, and instead read from an annoying script as is what appears now standard for outsourced tech support.On the other side, even though Trendnet doesn't support Linux, it was plug and play and worked as expected in Fedora 9. So the open source Linux guys *without pay* made a better driver than Trendnet "engineers"? Unbelievable, I don't think I'd ever buy another Trendnet product.So if you're planning on using it in Vista, steer clear. However for other OSes it may work. Since I bought it to use in a Vista box, this one goes back to the store.
Example: [Absolutely no sense] I wouldn't listen to the other reviews. Coming from a student who's done very well so far in all his other engineering courses, nothing in this book makes any sense at all. They jump into topics you've never even heard of, and expect you to know everything right off the bat. There aren't many examples, most of it's derivation, and the book takes a tone that you are a genious and will understand everything without a concrete explanation. I wouldn't get this if its not a required text, if I were you.
Example: [A boring disappointment] I read Shield of Three Lions and Banners of Gold in 1988. I know the year, because my daughter had just been born. To wait so long for a sequel and have it turn out like this!There is no adventure, no romance, no fun. It's mostly a big bore about the Magna Carta. We never get to see the big romantic reconciliation we wait for.If you read the first two books, you are better off writing your own ending. I feel that Ms. Kaufman's heart just wasn't in this one. Sorry kiddo! But I will still read any new books you write.
Example: [A Beginning Book good to learn from and have as a reference] This is one of two books written at about a high school reading level that I like that will show a beginner the piece movements, rules and simple strategies (like controlling the centre in the openings). The other book is more text bookish, Learn Chess (author is Alexander) with better instruction but not so full of colour and illustrations. I also like the Juniors Chess for Beginners that is at my reading level and very complete. I first learn chess in England, then have been playing in some chess tournaments that are scholastic.A very good point is that this book is full of colour and the illustrations are very good. Nice to leave on the table top in the living room, and not to be stuck in the boot when driving! Enjoy!
Example: [Beware the flat tube!] Purchased this TV and returned it after a week. Couldn't stand the picture anymore. Overall picture was okay, but the flat tube apparently has problems. Scrolling tickers across the bottom of the screen appear to be waving in the breeze. I looked at other flat tubes when I returned it, and saw 3 more on display with the same problem. Any horizontal graphic looks curved, bowed, or slanted -- anything but straight and level. Also, very difficult to get accurate colors on this TV. Much better off to spend a little more for an LCD.
Example: [A disappointing read........] I was quite disappointed in this point as I though it was going to go more in depth as to "why and how" companies are marketing to the masses AND classes. Instead, what I got was a lot of repetition about how each luxury buying group the writer has created chooses to spend their money. This is stated very early on in the book and repeated without any new data several times thoughout, which gets tiresome quickly. There are charts and graphs to back up this same data but even they are repeated multiple times. Skip this one if you are looking for more substance.
Example: [The all time jazz classic with great remastered sound!!!] I'll keep this short and sweet,this is an all time jazz classic,hands down!!! This awesome reissue features incredible remastered sound,a treat to listen to!!! A must for any serious music collection!!! Recommended!!! Timeless!!! A+
Example: [Shark Attack 2] In order to like this movie, you have to really enjoy shark movies. My son is fasinated with sharks.
Example: [In need of an editor] One star may be a little low, but I get the feeling the other reviews came from the author's relatives. Since I bought the book based on the five star rating, I feel the need to balance them out.First off, the book has an appeal. If you've ever been in high pressure sales- insurance, auto, etc.- you'll love the way this author captures the pressure of these jobs. The first of the novel is great in this regard and the story itself has a good premise.But I was unable to finish the book because of the writing itself. I get the feeling that the book was vanity published by a rich business man. The writing itself gets very redundant and is shot through with cliches. It also occasionaly switches from active to passive tense. In some books this works. In this case it pulled me out of the story.As much as I respect the author for doing it on his own, I must say that he should've sprung for a good editor as well as the publishing.
Example: [Excellent account of victimology in Black culture...] This is a well written account of how ingrained victimology is in contemporary black culture. It also demonstrates almost painfully how important it is for so-called black leaders to stop perpetuating racism by making everything into a black/white issue. I learned so much from this book!
Example: [Great concept, horrible design] We bought this for my 4 yr old for Christmas, because he love rollercoasters. There are not a lot of rollercoaster toys out there especially for his age. He was so excited to get it. I spent about 30 min putting this together. The pieces kept popping off. If one piece doesn't work the whole thing doesn't work! Also, the roller coaster track did not touch the ground at the end of putting it all together. I seemed like the track was not long enough. I got frustraed with the ferris wheel popping off the sides and decided to return in! We got two other rollercoaster sets recently that my 4 yr old loves and they work for about the same amount! Although it will be many years before he can put them together.
Example: [An exquisite piece of work] Nanni Moretti's quirky look at life is funny and deeply touching at the same time. I could watch this film many times before tiring of it. If you're a fan of deeply intelligent, unpretentious film making, this video is a must.
Example: [Rendevous Lounge, Vol 2 - Mark Gorbulew] This is a very disappointing CD. Unfortunately, everything sounds the same to me with the exception of Gypsy Woman by Montefiore Cocktail. I regret that I purchased it and play it very seldom due to the repetitious sounding music.
Example: [A must read!!] This is one of those books that make the reader wince and almost feel like a voyeur. But it is also an important book for all people interested in why people choose to live a lie, or live a life devoid of concern for the other gender as well as innocent children.It's an excellent book as far as a wake up call for those who wonder why a certain segment of our society seems to be floundering and destroying itself.I also suggest that this isn't a black issue, but one that crosses ALL racial groups, since I have heard for decades that Latino men live similar choices sexually.As a woman it is a book that ALL women should read a be forewarned about.Knowledge in power!
Example: [Entertaining light read] Fairly predictable, but the likeable characters are entertaining . I plan to pick up book two, even though I think it's fairly predictable who the next couple will be.
Example: [Great for the college bound kid, and for fast no oil popcorn.] I have had this item for around 10 years now, and It still works great when I want popcorn quick. No oil, so it's light and fluffy. Its a great alternative to my air popper, which i love, but hate the noise at times. This was great when I had it for my dorm room, saved buying microwave popcorn with all that oil, smell and disgustingly greasy bags. I could control what I put on it. Must have for the college kid.
Example: [Finally a Bible Translation that is not defamed by man!] If you are a seeker of "God's Truths" this New Testament Translation is for you. The church has moved away from understanding God's plan of salvation by wrongful and misleading bible translations, by human error and by political pressure of the time of the translation so that God's Truth is no longer clear in today's translations. I highly recommend anyone seeking to know God's Truth they pray about ordering this bible translation. Seek the Truth and the Truth shall set you Free.
Example: [Read with Care] This book may be of interest to residents of the anthracite region of Pennsylvania and those interested in the Molly Maguires and the history of Irish immigration in general. However, it is necessary to take the book with a large grain of salt. It suffers for want of professional editing, and there are many factual errors. For general historical background on the history of the Molly Maguires, there are better sources available.
Example: [cha cha slide] my son loves this song, and when I finally found it, I was so happy. He can now hear it whenever he wants at home. The cd has about 5 versions of the song, so you can hear it all different ways.
Example: [Wouldn't play] This CD would not play. I tried several different CD players, including my computer, and all the songs skip. Maybe it's pirated???? Don't waste your money - go to a music store.
Example: [Essential Subjects] While many of the chapters contain information that will never change this 20-year-old edition is very outdated for anyone who may be or planning on eing a Marine. There are more recent issues of the guidebook that should be offered as replacements for this antiquated issue.
Example: [Quiet, good power, good value.] I picked up my HF810 at one of the local Amazon assocites to replace an old box fan that had just given up the ghost. What a difference! This fan moves much more air with a fraction of the noise. The adjustible floor stand makes it easy to aim the fan without leaning it up against a chair or some other precarious pose. Pointed upward, it moves air as well as a ceiling fan.It's not perfect, but for the money it's a very good value. I plan on buying a second one soon.
Example: [An acorn fell on the Disney Corporation!] In one word "BAD." Disney calls this talent? It doesn't get much worse than this. No talent and not even close to the original story. I guess if you come from the computer generation of cold creation and you have been starved for real motion picture entertainment and you have a brain cell of a "nat" then you might enjoy this film. Be safe and buy your kid a real Disney movie meaning before Walt died and before Eisner took over. Disney has lost all of their true talent. All i can say is poor Walt......
Example: [soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo cute!] I got Bratz Babyz hair flair Sasha yestarday. It was my dead grandfathers birthday and as we do every year, me and my brother open presents and spend time with our aunts. She was a christmas present from my grandma.I made a tissue pajama dress for her and she looks cute. She comes with a hair barrete, a hair brush, a baby bottle, a blue/white oufit in 2 pieces,and a tiara. she has black hair in two pigtails with a bunch of little tiny braids, black skin with gorgeous brown eyes, and her fingers and toes are painted. i made a tissue box house for my hair flair babyz and all the other babyz(yasmin,cloe,dana,kiani, and roxxi) welcomed her. i love her so much and persuade you to buy her.
Example: [pleez!!!!!!!!!!] this cracks me up everytime i hear (or see it) he tries so hard to be michael jackson, but his so-called voice is way lower so when he sings all high it sounds like he's sqealing.As for the song itself it is a beatless,rhythmless,generic piece of ... which most people will call "a brilliant piece of pop".my.... More like a brilliant flop.
Example: [The Heritage Press Edition...] The Heritage Edition of 1974 is a large format hardback with bold type and ample margins. Black slipcase.Bound in a glossy red-orange, it is illustrated with 8 gravures by Mara McAfee and has an introduction by Ashley Montagu.Sewn binding; 237 pp.
Example: [Vaguely Interesting Mis-Fire From Usually Consistent Band] George Martin's pristine production saves this disappointing follow-up to the classic "Revolver." Song content consists of embarrasing odes to travelling shows, imaginary bands, and psychedelic songs about plants and nature, all with negligable emotional resonance. Band quickly saw this artistic path as a dead end and headed for more rewarding territory on "The White Album." Still beloved by a minority for some obscure nostalgic appeal, it's lasting influence is only visible in such minor performers as Lenny Kravitz and Klaatu.
Example: [Good story in the classic romance tradition.] Quite entertaining ...a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r
Example: [Atlas Shrugged Book Review] Wow, it is amazing how prophetic some of the content of this book is. It is timeless and a great novel, thanks.
Example: [Does not work with Blu Ray player] I bought two differet Living Landscapes HD blu ray movies and neither works in a blu ray player. Working on returning them.
Example: [Even if you don't cook/bake this is worth the money] Hello everyone, I have owned mine for about two years. To start with I didn't do much baking but when i did ( making Brownies or cakes) this was worth having and the money. Clean up is as easy as running hot water over it. Recently I have started baking breads and I have heard taht this model wasn't good for mixing dough. I have to totatlly disagree. This thing will need a 1.5 to 3 lb loaf from 5-30 minutes with easy. I am now making bread loafs from rustic, bagguettes, sourdoughs, and others, two to three times a week because of the ease of this machine. What use to take 30 minutes of hand kneading now takes 6 minutes on high spead to make perfect ciabatta bread.
Example: [PAPER JAMMED] AMAZON SHOULD NOT HAVE SOLD THIS MP530 PRINTER. AFTER PRINTING A FEW PAGES, THE ALARM LIGHT COMES ON AND IT STATES " PAPER JAMMED." TO DO MORE PRINTING YOU HAVE TO REMOVE THE PAPER, RAISE THE SECTION WHERE YOU CAN SEE THE INK JETS THEN LOWER,AND THEN PUSH THE " OK " BUTTON. FROM THEN ON YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW THIS PROCESS FOR EACH SHEET PRINTED. THE FIRST 2 WEEKS, I JUST UNPLUGGED THE PRINTER AND USED MY WIFE'S PRINTER AND REPLUG THE NEXT DAY. MANY TIMES I THOUGHT I WOULD SEND IT BACK BUT WHY SPEND THE SHIPPING COST. CANON WILL SELL A NEW PRINTER FOR JUST A LITTLE MORE THAN I PAID FOR THIS WORN OUT MACHINE; HOWEVER MY INK JETS COULD NOT BE USED IN THEIR NEW PRINTERS.
Example: [A yes, B no.] The .a half of this thing works just fine. I have an Netgear HE102 (.a only AP) and it seems comparable in performance.However the .b side is completely worthless. WEP or not, Netgear, Toshiba and other client adapters, all the same. No range, instable connection. Tried latest firmware, nada. Tried a pair of the WAB102's with same results. Steer clear of this thing. Get the HE102, or something better if you need .a, and get a $... special out of the sunday paper for your .b/.g needs.
Example: [RIght on] Just as expected. It's big and it blows air... Hey, it's "Swiss"... what else needs to be said.
Example: [Yippie Ki Yea Mother F****r] Truly one of Bruce Willis' best performances of his career. I think that Die Hard is one of the best action movies of all time. Every Christmas Eve I sit down and watch Die Hard from beginning to end. And this past Christmas I noticed something, how old Bruce Willis looks. That is, in his recent films. In fact, I hardly could recognize him. Can't wait till Die Hard 4 comes out.
Example: [Great Book] A friend from my wednesday night church group recommended this book to me. Every man needs to read this book. We are going to start the small group study in a couple of weeks for Wild At Heart. I can't wait. Read this book!
Example: [size matters] If you have the same system as I do, you are expecting to receivetwo (2) 16 x 12 1/2 filters. This vendor, eventhough the stocknumber calls for two filters, sends you one 16 x 25 filter whichdoesn't fit.Be aware.
Example: [Illogical and slanted] This entire book is one big logical fallacy. It sets up the KJV as the rule and compares all the other translations to it. Of course the other translations are going to be different! And if the KJV is the rule, any change in another translation is automatically seen as inferior. Also, if you even know a little bit about Greek and English grammar, you would know that it is impossible to have a word for word translation let alone letter for letter. I love the King James Translation, but we must remember that is a translation. We cannot reject the manuscripts. The only thing AWE inspiring about this book is that its 1200 pages of fallacy.
Example: [Memory lane] All the cars I fondly remembered growing up. A few more pictures would have made this a 5 star book.
Example: [This man is a genius] I first experienced Tom's cooking at the Dahlia Lounge about 3 years ago, and I was completely blown away. Visit after visit, meal after meal, his dishes always suprise and amaze me. His imagination with regards to food is incredible. The menu changes constantly and I think it just keeps getting better. But this is a review of his book... All of the recipes that have made all three of his restaurants famous are here. The thing that suprised me is that he is completely open with his "trade secrets". He's like a magician that can't wait to explain to you how to perform his trick, because he loves the magic that much: he wants everyone to be able to do it. And all the recipes work, too! I've made about 20 different thing from this book, and not one of them hasn't turned out perfectly. His style of writing is very accessable. And for the seattle resident, there is the bonus of a complete list of where to find all the best ingredients. A priceless book.
Example: [Talkity talk talk] This book starts with a good premise, but soon succumbs. This book has two main problems.1. Too little happens. If you look this book honestly, you soon regognize, that very little happens. which leads question what is done with all those pages? and problem two.2. Talk Talk Talk, oh boy do they like to talk. And go over same things again and again and again. And don't get me started with the cartridge case episode at the first half of the book.So to but it bluntly, this book is Boring. It was my first book from Griffin and my last.
Example: [pyle 7" rear vision monitor and camera] I have bought hundreds of things from Amazon and have been very satisfied. This item is the exception. It simply does not work well inbright daylight or at night. The lights never lit for night. It is my 2011 worse buy.
Example: [This is very very badly done............] I cannot beleive that this was made by Masterpice Theater,(who in my opion Love, and they have not dissapointment till now). Its a disgrace to Jane Austen and Fans everywhere as was the 1999 version, where do these people get thinking they can change a perfectly good story? I have read the book three times and dont understand why they must make a movie in "fast forward" mode. And another thing that just gets my goat is Fanny's Uncle is made to be a most horrible man , when in truth was a wonderful Uncle and Fanny was one of his favorites, He loved and repected her more than he did his wife and daughters, come on people get a clue and dont mess with good if you cant make it better or follow with what a billian Author made. I'm so sorry to make this so harsh but I just got it in today and cannot beleive i spent money on it.
Example: [both pair were damaged, Seller NEVER responded to emails] Both pair of cheap glasses arrived bent, one pair were too bent to use, the second pair were slightly bent but usable. For this cheap price, we did not expect high quality glasses, and we got what we expected, they were cheap quality but would have been sufficient, had they not been bent.We sent many emails to the seller, the seller NEVER, NOT ONCE, responded to our emails.I gave a two star instead of a one star for the following reasons: Cheap price equals low risk, if the glasses are wearable, it is worth the price (one pair of ours was only slightly bent and wearable--since the price was so low, the one pair was worth it)--but it was disappointing that the second pair was unwearable, and that the seller did not deem it worth their time to answer an email.
Example: [Don't last] I've used several brands of rechargeable batteries through the years (Monster, Radioshack, rayovac, etc.). They're all still working (recharge and hold their charge). The newer duracells rechargeable batteries are all DEAD (won't recharge to more than .6V). Could it be that duracell purposefully makes really crappy rechargeables to sell more regular batteries? Surely not!? or? Note: This review applies to Duracell Rechargeable AA NiMH 2650mAh AND 2500mAh batteries (strangely the Duracell AAA seem fine).
Example: [worse one of her series] Just one word of it "terrible"!!! I've read all her FBI/Mystery series and this is by far the worst. The story is all over the place and the characters are never really developed. It was very painful reading this one...really bad! One thing I'm finding with Catherine Coulter is a hit or miss with her books. The Maze was great and after reading The Edge, you will have a hard time believing it's the same writer.
Example: [Shark Vac] Was very disappointed on how cheaply made it was. I have bought several and this one is by far a lower quality that is available.
Example: [Infecting summer 2003 with JOY.] While to me, it's disappointing to see Sugar Ray has strayed from they're solid rock sound from the self titled album (which I give 5 stars), In the Pursuit of Leisure is a collection of songs that fit right in with everything summer is about. Grooving to these tunes isn't hard to do... aside from the first single Mr. Bartender (which is to me just a dance song that'll make you tap your feet), this album is filled with songs you almost feel guilty for enjoying for a second or tird listen. Regardless of the fact that this CD to me is a step below what the self titled cd had to offer, it's hard not to like songs like the one's found here. I reccomend this Sugar Ray offering to anyone looking for a smile.
Example: [Overall, a good read] George reprises her strong characterization and plot lines in this book. The ending is particularly satisfying, suspenseful, and believable. I especially enjoyed the continuing developments between Havers and Lynley. The one drawback: the chapters alternate between narrative and a first-person viewpoint from a major character. It's harder to follow than some of George's previous work, but worth the effort.
Example: [Message is clear without understanding the words] The viewer has a bird's eye view of the simple life in a family in Mongolia. They are a tight unit and support each other in all their daily activities. The weeping camel stands out when she finally accepts her little offspring and it is touching to realize that so many of the human race are dying from the lack of love and affection. This really touched my heart.
Example: [Best phone i have ever owned] This phone is amazing. What people are going to have to understand is that there will be and always will be problems or features the service provider has or the phone has...some of these are planned by the companies themselves...so you will buy another phone(a more expensive one)...ex. LG L1400 doesnt have speakerphone but the V551 does and the V551 doesnt have the second screen but the L1400 does....its all up to preference and the people who put these phones down should have looked at the features before they start purchasing expensive phonesIf you like what you see in the description and the feature menu for this phone it is WELL worth the investment and so is the V551. These are two very exceptional phones and I recommend both of them. I however chose the LG phone simply b/c I wanted the second screen ( I did alittle homework...hm what do ya know.)Oh and if you ever need a flashlight open the L1400 its pretty bright.
Example: [Rocamojo] Best price on internet and it qualifies for supersavings shipping from amazon. Would recommend that everyone buy thru amazon as we have had a bad experience with other merchants carrying this product. It is a great coffee substitute...tastes great.
Example: [Don't waste your time] I absolutely loved "Secret Life of Bees", so I couldn't wait to read another of Sue Monk Kidd. However, "The Mermaid Chair" is quite possibly the worst book I have ever read! First of all, the plot is incredibly close to "Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood." Could she not think of anything on her own? Second, the supposed "plot twist" was nothing more than a mere paragraph of nonsense that left me extremely disappointed. Finally, as this book is supposed to be powerful to women; however, it leaves the reader with the idea that you need a man to be complete. I can't believe I actually finished it! Such a disappointment.
Example: [Seems like fun] We receive this as a baby shower gift. It seems like fun with the cute characters and prints. It was able to keep my baby entertained for about 20 - 30 minutes each time. Those butterflies are useless. The description says "butterflies spin at baby's touch"; but, it's way too high for young babies to reach. It would be better if the manufacture had put a motor in it.
Example: [Wow] Seriously... I opened this after over 12 hours and my coffee was still steaming. I was shocked! I mean you had to look for the steam, it wasn't obvious, but I don't care, after 12 hours if it's even still warm I'm impressed.
Example: [Good price!] What can you say about filters? It keeps out the cat hair. Works as it should.This is the best price I could find.
Example: [Eleventh Tiger] A very good first Doctor novel set in 1865 Japan. The Doctor lands right in the middle of an English foray into Japan with Ian mysteriously recognised and attacked by one of the locals. They spend time in a Japanese medical facility and it finishes where it started in caves. Just the right amount of science fiction and historical fact mixed together very well.
Example: [Wonderful Seller] This movie was delivered to me before I expected to have it and in perfect condition. Brand new. I would highly recommend purchasing from this seller and plan to do so myself in the future.
Example: [Offers consistently 5-star recipes] This cookbook is excellent. I often check out cookbooks from the library and it is hard to find ones that offer recipes that are consistently 5-star. After making about ten recipes and only disliking one, I went ahead and purchased this gem. It contains a little of everything, from your standard pesto to truffles to instructions on how to spatch-cock a Cornish hen. The additional instructions, explanations and history lessons are invaluable in helping out with the planning process that goes into making a meal. And to boot this book can be had for only $10.00.
Example: [THIS IS NOT A WORKOUT DVD*!!] If you have absolutely NO knowledge on how to hit a heavy bag than you shouldn't even be using one. This brief dvd will NOT educate you on the proper way to hit a bag. Just different combinations that even the most clueless to this sport would know.. The jab cross combos ETC. It does not provide you with even ONE ten minute work-out routine. It's just one hour of this man talking, basically. To return it isnt even worth the money I would get back after I paid for shipping.I give it 2 stars only because it educated you on how to adjust your speed-bag platforms and make changes so you can have the proper rhyme.. IE. adding a wood panel the same circumferance on top of the platform and drilling through.. I suggest you keep looking.
Example: [Super collection] Very pleased to have all of these wonderful Dr. Seuss cartoons on one DVD! Great collection of some old favorites! The kids and I will enjoy this one for years to come.
Example: [What were they thinking?] OK... I'll give them this: the scenery with the temples and such was nice to look at, but the script was awful, the acting was awful, and the whole thing just ...stank. I asked Blockbuster for my money back.Six of us watched the movie and we all were left dumbfounded that anybody even funded this boondoggle. I think my dog could write a better script.If I could possibly give this movie "0" stars, I would.
Example: [Good Concept, but...] The idea seems good, but when you are in the shower, the tablet needs to be directly under the water. This does not allow you to receive much of the water. Also, the vapors tend to bypass the nostrils and goes straight to the eyes, which causes slight tearing and a burning sensation. Lastly the tablet heats up and you can't touch it at all, which also keeps you away from the water. Sorry that I can't give this product a higher rating, it has too many flaws.God bless!
Example: [Great Cutting Board For the Money!] This is a great cutting board for the money. Its well made and is working out great! My wife just loves it! I gave it to her as a early Christmas gift. We have had it 3 1/2 weeks now and it has not discolored or warpped its still looks like new and it has been used daily so far so good as of 12/20/2008
Example: [Verry usefull German grammar learning tool] This was a very useful reference tool while learning German. Shipment and delivery was prompt.
Example: [EJD is probably the best out there.] I won't give a synopsis or anything like that but I really enjoyed this book. This is another book of his that I almost hated reading because I don't want it to end. I hope he puts out two books a year from now on. He also doesn't pander to the women like most black authors tend to do. They forget that men read too.I bought this book on Monday and my wife and I are both done reading it and today is Thursday.EJD keep doing what you doing, the men like reading your stuff too.
Example: [Broken Upon Delivery] I've needed this kind of light in my apartment for a while now. However, when I was assembling the light, I discovered that the head was not properly screwed on. It cannot be repaired easily; the parts in the head are weirdly assembled and not simple to take apart. Also, the dimmer knob is wobbly and not tight.Basically, if I don't touch it, and it just stands there, it's fine. If I bump it, or turn it on or off, it's pretty unstable.
Example: [Great Insight] This book is written for men but should be read by every wife or wife to be - even young Christian women who are dating. It truly gives an insight into what may be on a man's heart or what may have wounded his heart. This insight can be invaluable to the strength of the relationship and the understanding of the wife's role in the man's life. This could result in a more meaningful and deeper marriage relationship!
Example: [To tell the truth?] When brother and sister are playing soccer in the house they end up breaking mama's favorite lamp! They try making up a lie to get of of the blame. But can they keep their story straight>?This book teaches kids how it is better to tell the truth and not to lie no matter what they have done. It is a great lesson to me learned and I suggest it for any child!
Example: [Interesting and Imaginative] I found W.T. Smith's film to be an innovative and imaginative response to the work of Manzarek and McClure. He managed to bring a genuinely cinematic sensibility to a subject that does not, on the surface, suggest such a response. I recommend this documentary to anyone who is interested in the beats or performance poetry.
Example: [I HAVE BEEN RIPPED OFF!!!] I bought hylexin from 101BeautyStore. Before purchasing it I emailed him and asked the expiration date and if the item was original. I received an email back claiming that the item is fresh and genuine. Everything has gone normal until the use of 1/3 of the cream. After 1/3 has been used another 1/3 was full of liquid inside. The expiration date was good but the originality of the item is a big question mark???? By the way the good effect of the eye cream is far away then the ones I used before. The item is not original and genuine. DON'T BUY FROM HIM!!!!
Example: [Trial and error experience combined with knowledge] Defining Your Own Success: Breastfeeding After Beast Reduction Surgery is specifically written to enable mothers who have had breast reduction surgery to breastfeed their babies. Though breastfeeding after such surgery is generally thought impossible, recent advances in breast reduction surgical techniques now allow lactation capabilities to be better retained than in the past. Trial and error experience combined with knowledge has allowed thousands of post-surgical women to breastfeed in spite of the obstacles. Defining Your Own Success explicitly describes how to maximize a woman's milk supply and confront challenges. A special section is also devoted specifically to the professional perspective, from health care providers to plastic surgeons and maternity nurses. Personal anecdotes and several appendices round out this well thought-out reference. Highly recommended.
Example: [Noz a must see!] junk!!n junk jink!! terrible unfuuny movi thaz waz ruining by Chirs tucker. when will thisz guy become funny?? will thatz day ever happen??!! he just kept on talking TRYING to make a joke after joke. chan wasn't thT GREAT EITHER. really bad movie that i'm suprisedz to knowz people will like.n it just proves anything canz getz made today, and someone will always like it. pure junk......word out!
Example: [Ouch] Well, I'm a Pagan and I did not like this book. It was written at a time when the Christians were starting on a major campaign to slaughter Pagans and bring us into the Dark Ages. But rather than say all the things I disliked about it, I'll just let anyone who wants to know what I think of it e-mail me.
Example: [Love Comes Softly Series] I love this entire series and have followed it since Love Comes Softly came out a couple of years ago. Can't wait to see the 7th in the series tonight, Love Takes Wings and the next which will be April 11 I think and has Patty Duke in it. Although the movies don't follow the books exactly and some of the characters are different, it's still a great series and one that I'll watch over and over again. Michael Landon, Jr. is great!
Example: [microsuede feather king comforter set chocolate] I PURCHASED THIS ITEM AS A WEDDING GIFT ASSURED THAT SINCE I BOUGHT IT FROM AMAZON THE PARTY I GAVE I TO WOULD NOT HAVE ANY PROBLEMS. NEVERTHELESS AND UNFORTUNATELY,AFTER THEY USED IT FOR ABOUT 5 DAYS, THE FEATHERS STARTED TO SHED, AND THEY HAD TO BUY A DUVET TO COVER IT, THIS EMBARRASSED ME.I SUGGEST THAT AMAZON CHECK THE MERCHANDISE BEFORE SENDING IT TO THEIR CUSTOMERS.THANK YOUYOLANDA ROVIROSA
Example: [Good not great] I enjoyed this movie for a one time watch. The story was engaging enough to keep me interested and it had enough action to keep me watching. I don't regret renting it but would never watch it again.
Example: [SBC Helldiver in Action - Aircraft No. 54] The book was for my husband for a project (painting) he was working on. It helped him to answer a question he was pondering so it was a good purchase for him. He has many of these books in his library but did not have the one on the Helldiver. Thanks!
Example: [Very entertaining for kids (toddlers)] Frankly I don't know why this series is so sought-after by toddlers like my children, but perhaps it is a generational difference and perhaps I will never understand. However, it is obviously very much in demand and very entertaining for little kids. My daughter watches this almost every day. We have lots of Dora programs aside from this. I even had to order some Dora dolls. They must be doing some great marketing. Only thing I don't like is all the Spanish mixed with English, as it may confuse some young kids which is what and may end up mixing languages into Spanglish. Huge commercial success, obviously.
Example: [I must be really dim] I have tried and tried to read this book, and just cannot get into it, get it, be inspired by it, stay with it, have an "aha" moment--and I have given this book more chances than I've ever given any book. I am puzzled. Maybe I'm just dim. I don't get it.
Example: [colour drops out, frustrating response from Panasonic Australia] When it works, it's great. However each time I go on a research trip to Europe or N America (ie. costing me a lot of cash) an intermittent fault occurs where the image (in still mode or video)drops out the red range, so the recorded image has a blue cast. I am an art historian, so bringing back faulty data is not good for my research. And dealing with Panasonic Australia is a nightmare. Neither the shop, or the repairer, or the company will take final responsibility. I have sent it away twice, and today send it back for another test. Even when you provide them with the hard evidence of the fault, the camera comes back just as it was. Next stop the small claims tribunal...
Example: [Why so morbid?] Wonderfully written but generally morbid. I loved Stones and immediately again appreciated Hegi's incredible writing ability. Like Stones, the environment in which the stories take place is grey and depressing. Some of the stories are very uplifting but most are about horrible things that happen to regular people. The only reason the repetition of this type of story makes sense to me is that at a certain age these are the types of things kids focus on.
Example: [The best looking water kettle on the market.!] The first electric water kettle I owned was a Black and Decker and it died after 6 months. Since than I've owned a Krups, toastmaster, Kenwood, Russell Hobbs, and Philips and two Braun tea kettles(I liked the Braun so much I had to buy a second). Not only is the Braun the most beautiful but it and the Philips are the most functional of the groups and I use them several times a day. The Braun unit I have been using for about the last 4 years and it has never failed me and is still going strong. I look to many more years from this great appliance.
Example: [Dremel Planer] Feel Cheated!There are many websites that claim that the DREMEL XPR PLANER is compatible with many Dremel Multis . When I recieved the planer the box stated only for the 400 Model! When I contacted Dremel they said that although it might fit it is unsafe to use for only the 400 is fast enough! Most reviews of the 400 say that it's not worth the upgrade. The cost and bother of returning is not worth it. I am stuck with it.Don't buy unless you are planning to get the 400- it is probably included in most kits.
Example: [Good Watch with band issue] This watch originally had a plastic or resin band that broke frequently, every few months, and the replacement band is stainless. It works fine except for the dim night light feature. The band does not appear to fit as well as it should and thus pops off. The band and watch have a poor fit where the pin inserts to secure the band and watch together. Other than that, it works very well.Given all the posted complaints with the resin bands and pins failing on the stainless bands you have to wonder why Timex does not care to fix either issue. As much as I like the durability of the timepiece, that band problems make it hard to recommend. You should not have to buy a Rolex to get a watch that remains on your wrist.
Example: [Behind the Scenes with the Best] When Satriani heard that Jimi Hendrix had died, he quit his high school football team and took up guitar. This video unfolds tantalizing bits and pieces of this master's career. It spans history from the days when he taught guitar lessons for $5.00 each (Steve Vai, another master guitarist was one of his students) through the early 90's.The movie is made up of interviews with Satriani, his peers, and his producers, interspersed with concert footage and music videos. Comic relief is provided by "interview" footage with Spinal Tap's guitarist.If you like excellent guitar work, if you worship creativity and excellence, if you simply want to get some clue as to how Joe works his magic with his axe, you need to own this movie. If, on the other hand, your taste in guitar is more firmly grounded in Juaquin Rodriguez or the Romeros, you'll be rather disappointed with this incredible Blues/Rockfest.
Example: [cute but cheap] I generally write pretty enthusiastic reviews of things I buy on amazon but not here. The toy box is adorable, I'll grant you that. It holds a lot which is also nice. However, it is unbelievably cheaply made. The pre-drilled holes don't even remotely line up so I had to break out the drill and fix it myself. The wood is cheap and soft, scratches easily, and is poorly stained. It would be an acceptable product if it cost half the price they are selling it for but it's a rip off at the listed price.
Example: [Zzzzzzzzzzzzzz. Gag. Zzzzzzzzzzzzz.] Not funny. Disjointed. Boring. Pointless. Dumb. What a waste of money
Example: [Bad Disc's] I have been a fan of this show for years. I too bought each season as it came out. Three weeks ago I purchased the box set because I wanted the movies. Unfortunatly my set was very deffective. The very first disc would only play for the first 20 minutes and then stopped. Upon checking the rest of the disc's I found all but 2 had mild to moderate scratching. The packaging is terrible. I had to return my set.
Example: [fantastic!!!] coming from a non-reader, this book hooked me into reading. it is much better than the movie
Example: [PS2 Guitar Hero I -- great game!] This is a great game. My son and I played it in the store a month or so before Christmas and I was so happy that he put it on his wish list so that I would be able to play too! So he got it for Christmas and it was a hit with everyone. I think some of the songs are pretty difficult, but then I haven't played it very much. With 3 levels, there's a lot of room to improve your skills, and still be challenged. And then, there's Guitar Hero II! Definitely recommend!
Example: [No grass] We live in the Seattle area, I always have said if you can't grow a lawn here, then give up. Got this to fix up a couple spots, followed the directions, and nothing. I wouldn't get it again.
Example: [Brilliant!] I'm no classical buff, in fact I'm more into alternative stuff,but this CD is beautiful.If you ever wanted some classical work, and wantedsomething a bit off the beaten track, i.e.not the stuff you hear in adverts, this if for you.Checkout the samples...you'll end up playing it for years and years.I know I never get bored of it.
Example: [Pigman] The Pigman was a great book.At first when I heard about it,I thought it sounded dull.But It's not.It's one of the best books I've ever read!Everyone should read it.
Example: [Buttery Good] My son loves these you do not have to add extra butter-sometimes I add leftover chicken-quick & easy
Example: [need return the item] I bought this items on APR/28/2012 and it getting very and very noisy after 2 months. I need someone contact with me and return this item.
Example: [So Disappointed...poorly made] Received this as a gift from a catalog. I picked it out myself, thinking that, despite reviews, surely it will be better than our previous toaster oven that heated unevenly. When we received it, I was thrilled. The idea and functionality is a good one, but the execution is poor. The oven feature didn't work, we had to slam the slider over hard to get it to stay lit. Usually it just turns off automatically, not in a temperature control way, the heating elements just don't turn on at all. I finally called Hamilton Beach, and because we received it as a gift, and their warranty doesn't include shipping and handling, now I have to pay to have it shipped to me. Trust me, from a normally optimistic consumer, stay away. Look for a sturdier product with known quality control.
Example: [Just sad] Plot, writing, and dialog are rediculous. Both actors could do a much better job, but given the sillyness of the whole thing, did passibly well. Really silly b-movie horror ending. Yuck.
Example: [I really love these books!] I think these are a really great books! There're fun,interesting, and you never want to put them down. Julie is an awesome heroine. These books are a really good way to look at the way Eskimos live. I highly recommend them.
Example: [John Hiatt] Super adult, contemp. music.Heard a song during the movie, "RAISING HELEN"...researched it, foundit (THIS JOHN HIATT ALBUM)...didn't stop playing it for 3 days!!!!Loved every track on it. What a gem.Would highly recommend it, just for pure vocals and soothingdynamic. LOVED IT!
Example: [A wacky yet insightfull journey] Comics are more profound than you remember. They are an effective means to tell a narrative and in these pages you will feel emotions that you thought not possible within this medium. Be patient and yes, read the instrucctions before you begin.
Example: [Not bad at all!] Excellent cast. Interesting story line. And humor thrown in as well. The movie was actually fun to watch. For a nostalgic trip from years past, go for it. I believe you'll like it too.
Example: [Not trendy] I watched and did the program presented in this video for the first time yesterday and really enjoyed it. I read a lot of the reviews here and so many complain about the yoga being slow and easy. I think that if one really works in the poses and remains active in them then this is a great workout. If you do not have the patience or concentration for that, then buy Buns of Steel. Yoga requires patience. Plus Suzanne Deason was trained in Iyengar Yoga which is not all about violent movements and sweating and straining and...well maybe it is not trendy. But yoga should not be about that anyway.
Example: [Poor] If only I'd realized that this CD is Tony Christie re-recording his best songs in a trashy "Europop" style. It sounds like a CD of cheap covers, not much resemblance to the Tony Christie original versions that I remember. Stay away from this CD and buy "The Very Best of Tony Christie" instead (ASIN: B00000DB0C). Sorry Tony, but if it ain't broke don't fix it!
Example: [Not the best World's Finest book I've ever read.] First let me say that this is not a standalone book. If you don't know the history of Batman and Superman there will be places where you'll stop and go "huh?" I felt Mr. Kessel could have done a much better job referencing this history rather than just expecting the reader to know it. That said, I thought the book started off very well. The first four years (the book covers a ten year period) was well written and very enjoyable. The fifth year, which dealt with Mxyzptlk and Bat-Mite, was fun. Unfortunatly, the book goes down hill from there. I found the ending to be silly and completely unsatisfying. Which pretty well sums up the last half of the book.
Example: [GPS not reliable] When I first purchased this item, I loved it. There were a few times the GPS led me astray, but generally, it really helped me get from place to place in my job. It helped my find places where I did not know where they were, or helped my find short cuts from place to place. However, soon after I got it, it quit "acquiring satellites". It would try and try to find satellites (even though it showed them on one of the screens). Most often it would never find the satellites, or if it did, it was about the time I arrived at my location. The GPS had trouble no matter what location I was in, whether rural or city. I sent it in for repair, and from what I can tell of the paper I received when it was returned (which was very vague)to me, they replaced it. Unfortunatly, it is still doing the same thing. It is a great data management system, however, and I love that it interfaces with "Word". The GBS is a big disappointment. It's overpriced for what it can truly provide.
Example: [Great product] I've owned at least 6 similar products over the years but this one is the best yet. It is a bit more expensive than the others but truly makes up for it in quality and efficiency. Dirt and crumbs disappear off hard surfaces on the first pass. The product is extremely maneuverable, getting into corners and against base moulding with ease. Though not designed to be a primary tool for vacuuming carpets, it does a great job on the fir needles and grass caught by the throw-rugs inside our doors.
Example: [Will Ackerman's Best CD] Wow! Not since I first heard Passage, years ago, have I been so moved by one of Will Ackerman's CD's. (Passage was life changing.) He has gone back and allowed the essence of the music to emerge as a good port will develop only with the passage of time. Mature, slowed, and played with understanding, these are some of his best studio recordings.
Example: [Best! If you want to know what a verse means.....] This is one of the best works on exegesis. Not as heavy as "The Modern Preacher and the Ancient Text" but is a good pair with it. The five chapters dealing with interpreting Scripture, if followed exactly, should give the reader the exact meaning of the text of Scripture being studied. I have recomended this book to many--it is for all people who use the Bible. If you want to understand what a certain verse means, then this tool can get you there.Corrects many false views and assumptions one brings to the text of Scripture... if only all Christians would not follow the instructions here, exactly.
Example: [Arguably the best worship CD ever] Here we are, eleven years after this CD was released, and if I had to name the best worship album I have ever heard I would pick this one. To me, this is what Vineyard worship music is all about -- intimate, authentic, and meant to be entered into. I still listen to it once in a while and it still touches something inside and re-ignites that Hunger.
Example: [I very much enjoyed this book] Stabenow manages to capture perfectly the chaotic feel of Alaska life. I worked up there several summers and it felt like I was back in one of the frontier towns that I remember fondly. This is pretty far into the Shugak series, but a librarian recommended that I start with this book. I found that I did not need to read any of Stabenow's other books in order to fall in love with Shugak and the series. Since then I have pretty much read them all and I would say that none of them quite matches this one. So if you have not read any Shugak mysteries yet, this might be a good place to start.What's so unusal about this book while comparing it to both others in the series as well as other mysteries, is that it pretty much doesnt have a mystery. Instead what makes this such a fun read is that you are lead on an excursion into the life of the protagonist that is well worth following along upon.
Example: [Entry Level Arturo] Perez-Reverte is at his most accessable in this Iberian soaked tale of drugs, death and defiance. Typically, his female lead is gutsy, gritty, gorgeous and ruminates on the eternal 'whys' of fate, love, mercy and cruelty.The Queen of the South is tightly paced compared to many of Perez-Reverte's other novels and perhaps because of this the depth of nuance found in The Fencing Master or The Nautical Chart, is missing here. Still we cannot help but want more.Perez-Reverte writes with a touch that is personal to everyone and accessable to many. The Queen of the South may also be the best-translated of his novels. For those new to the genre, its a great entry point into the best Spanish-speaking literature we have today.
Example: [Loses what makes them so good] These remixes are a mixed bag, and overall, a disappointment to those like me who rate Bowery Electric at the height of their genre (much better than, say, Massive Attack) for their uncanny intuitive spot-on ability to find perfect real (almost hybrid sexual and meditative) grooves. Basically these tracks take those grooves and add on what really is so annoying about most others in the field, namely the typical pitfalls of drum and bass: loud artificial drum machines and casio-like atmospherics. Even the good tracks like "Empty Words" suffer.If you're a fan of the genre in general, this is nice double-cd to pick up. There are enough interesting moments and ideas and a few wonderful tracks to make the modest price well worth it. Would I put this on when I have company? Never. Definitely not in the same class as "Lushlife" or "Beat."
Example: [Skips!!!] I bought a few seasons, and I've made it through the fourth so far. Two or three of the episodes are completely unwatchable, because it skips so bad. Even though I bought it because the quality was "very good," the case was not in great condition and the disc was CLEARLY and VISIBLY damaged. Sure enough, when I try to play it, it skips!
Example: [A book for all ages] This book won the Newberry Honor book for a reason. In my opinion it should have been the Winner. This is a thougthful, well written book. It is full of great characters in a thought provoking story. Seeing the story of Malaga Island and the town of Phippsburg through the wise young eyes of Turner Buckminster was brilliant. Gary Schmidt is a master at telling the story of "adolescents turning their face toward adulthood." I heard Gary say those very words last week when I heard him speak at a local community dinner. I was very moved by all he talked about. It is clear that he is a gifted storyteller on paper and in voice. Lizzie Bright tells an important story about ignorance, prejudice and growing up. As an adult who loves to read well written juvenile fiction, I am looking forward to more great books by Gary Schmidt.
Example: [Mormonism - another view] It is a far too widespread trend in this country that all religions are supposedly created equal and that all lead to God/heaven. Thank God for this pamphlet that shows that Mormonism is NOT the same as Christianity and that unless one accepts Jesus in complete poverty of spirit as THE Son of God and THE only way to heaven and fellowship with God, IT IS NOT TRUE!JOHN 14:6 "I AM THE WAY, THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE AND NO ONE COMES TO THE FATHER EXCEPT BY ME!!!" (EMPHASIS MINE)
Example: [Printer Not Vista Compatible] The printer works great with my computer running XP SP1, but is not compatable with a newer computer running XP or any of my laptops that are running Vista. The fact that this printer is NOT Vista compatible should be highlighted.
Example: [Disappointed] I have no idea what this book really contains - I want to review the book, not really the prices, but what it containes so I know I am ording the right book, but all it says is Avon Bottles, Research and History. Research and history of what kind of old Avon bottles? It may not be the one I want or contains the bottles I want to price to sell. So basicly it's no good to me until I know what any of your books covers.
Example: [It's Been Too Long a Wait] The anticipation of the release of Joan's first album in nearly 8 years has been excruciating for her fans, but the wait has surely paid off with LOVERS SPEAK, her most effective release in years. Hearkening back to her earliest work, most notably her self-titled 1976 release, LOVERS SPEAK contains some of Joan's best songs ever, from the catchy title track, to the haunting "In These Times" (could this song's timing be more perfect?) to "Prove Yourself," an up-tempo, bluegrass-sounding tune that will have you singing along with its catchy chorus. As always, the songs are all Joan originals, with Joan providing all the vocals and most of the instrumentation. For the long-time Joan fan, and the new converts to her music, you will not be disappointed. It's a remarkable CD.
Example: [The BEST History of Art Ever Written!!!!] Whenever people mention art or art history, I think back to my Humanities classes at Michigan State. Gombrich's "The Story of Art" was a delighful text. Thorough, yet written in a way that was understandable to someone with very little exposure to art and all the nuances. "The Story of Art" makes the "Study" of art enjoyable. I have often regretted re-selling my text back to the book store since it would have made a wonderful reference. How delighted I am to find this book to still be available!!!
Example: [Great Buy!] These speakers are excellent! I wanted something for my computer so I could hear my DVD and play my games and it's great! No distortion at all!
Example: [Good IF experienced, don't touch if new to Java] Book has some errors, and if used ONLY for the test, you will fail. It glosses over a lot of topics and is good if you haven't touched Java in a while and need a refresher. I took the test after using this book and failed, looked up some questions I new I missed, and they weren't even in the book, no wonder I didn't pass. Got a more detailed book and passed easily. Barry Boone is good...just doesn't have a Java 2 book yet, but his ver. 1.1 book filled a LOT of gaps Brogden doesn't touch. Brogden says 'Native methods are not on the exam.' uh, yeah. Both times I took the exam, a question about Native methods was on the exam. Good for something...and that's a paperweight or a refresher.
Example: [Great packing tape that is thick and sound free.] I love this packing tape. It is thick and sturdy. It won't tear through heavy boxes. I used these for moving and they were very strong. Also what I really love is that it doesn't make sound when I unroll the tape.
Example: [Fake ?] Are you joking ? "Cobalt coated titanium"Titanium is HARDER than cobalt, why would you coat titanium with a rockwell hardness of 75 with cobalt that is only 65 ?I am sure these are junk without even buying them.
Example: [Notable improvement in performance] I got these about a week ago and changing the foil and blades introduced a notable improvement in the performance of the razor. It is almost as good as new now.
Example: [Thick Milk Shake Straws] These straws are great to use for old fashioned thick milk shakes that we make at our farm market. I was a little disappointed that the length was not specified clearly when I ordered-they are longer than what I was looking for, but they work ok.
Example: [Horrendous...] 1) This is an ancient reprint. The typeface used is very poor and the reproduction is often not dark or large enough.2) Only using a Romanization makes this book almost useless when working with a native speaker. Without reinforcing Chinese characters at every opportunity, the student is wasting their time.3) No explanation of pronounciation and tone system makes the book of ZERO value when trying to learn on your own. (I suppose if you already spoke Taiwanese, the book would have some value, but... why would you buy it if you already spoke Taiwanese?)4) There is no organization of grammar.5) Worst: I have no idea if Kejia Hua (Hokkien) is that similar to Taiwanese. This book is a "conversion" of a Hokkien book. Had the title clearly indicated as such, I certainly would not have bought this.6) Only positive: paper is suitable bonfire or latrine use.7) Consummer fraud any way you slice it... maybe ok at a yard sale of $0.25, but no more...
Example: [J'aime Oscar!] <3 <3 <3 <3 Classic, how can you NOT love Oscar Wilde? Fantastic selection of prose. <3 <3 <3 <3
Example: [pitiful] These hammers are the worse excuse for deadblow hammers I"ve ever seen.I wrote Cummins and they refuse to return my e-Mail.The product does not qualify for Industrial grade. Would not recommend to any mechanics.
Example: [Wait, Warner Brothers WILL rstore Popeye in 2007!] Warner Brothers is in the process of restoring the classic B&W and Color Popeye Cartoons for a 2007 release. Original Paramount main & end titles will be a part of the restoration.
Example: [A waste of time] Honestly, the biggest mystery with this book is how it got published. The author is a newspaper journalist, but he's thrown all his training out the window for this book as it meanders around, seemingly pointlessly, for page after page after dreary page.Maybe if I'd finished it I would have got the point. I didn't.
Example: [Dogs not interested] My dog are so uninterested in this that it might as well be invisible. I even put liver treats in it and tried to show them how to play with it. Neither dog would bother with it at all. (One is Female 4 yr old greyhound/lab/shephard mix, other is female 4 month old lab/border collie mix - both are very playful & love treats)Very disappointed.
Example: [Waste of money] I am sorry I bought this thing. It's way too complicated to set up, and yes, I read the instructions...they only added to my frustration. I would not recommend this product at all and will think 3 times before purchasing anything else from this manufacturer.
Example: [Don't Waste Your Money] I bought this book as a Christmas present for a friend thinking that I was getting him a great present. However, when I recieved the book, I opened it to see for myself how funny it really was. NOT FUNNY AT ALL! All this book consists of is mindless ramblings of celebrities and nothing at all even close to funny. I never ended up giving this to my friend because it was so lame. I showed the book to my Mom to see if maybe she knew someone who liked corny stuff... she told me she would never give that book to anyone. I am not the kind of person who is hard to entertain. Usually if a see a someone get kicked in the face on T.V., I'm laughing all day. I'm looking at the book now trying to find some "fabulous" quoteto share with you, but SURPRISE! There does not exist even ONE that is worthy. You can be sure that I'm sending this one back!
Example: [Excellent Muffler] This is perfect for my ride and what I wanted. A muffler which has a sporty look, which is quiet enough for daily driving, but comes alive when I put my foot down and the v-tec kicks in (JDM 2000 Honda Accord SiR).
Example: [Weak] Nothing special about this. Whitewash is pure garbage. I get the point behind it, but why must these types of film always be about the struggle of black people? I'm not racist, but don't really like being stereotyped as a bleach-white faced jerk.
Example: [A must buy] This movie takes you back to the New York's golden age, when women got thier hair done to go out to dinner and men wore suits to the go see the Dodger's play. In the middle of it all was Toots Shore, restaurant owner and friend of many, if you had a dollar you could go ot Toots and have a drink. My grandparents and parents told me of the great times they had there, and after seeing the film, I only wish I could've been there with them.....
Example: [THEY ROCK!] They are awesome! You can tell just by listening to the way they sing they really have a love for God! They're sooo good! They're my favorite!
Example: [Perfect] This went in my new cabinets and is a second one, as I already had one. It's exactly what I need and does exactly what it says. I set my cabinets up with my adjustable shelves so that I can hang glasses upside down and still have space underneath to put other glasses. I've already had envious looks from people who come and see my new kitchen.
Example: [Just what I needed!] Right price, very easy to set up, quieter than my treadmill or old exercise bike, and I can use my own bike. I use a "bike leveler" for the front wheel. I change gears to change the level of intensity of my workout. I'm not a bike pro nor a "spinner" - so I don't need a lot of bells and whistles - so this suits my needs perfectly, without having to make a huge investment in expensive equipment. Note: I had a helper when setting up my bike in the trainer.
Example: [Rucker the Millionaire] This game was fun and exciting, it gave me the change to apply some of the things I was learning in ECON to real life, it also had an competitive aspect were you compete with the computer and its actaully a challenge!!! Played this game for hours while listening to Personal development, great game.-Rucker the MillionaireMan of God
Example: [Gotta love the [...] kicking old farts] As a 50 year old runner and biker, I loved this book. I am now firmly entrenched in middle age and need the occasional inspiration to get out on the trails of Houston especially during the brutally hot summers. This book is full of what I need. A beautifully photographed and written book portraying active seniors competing and loving life, some well into their 90s. Truly amazing. The book is generally formatted with a picture and a few paragraphs written about and in some cases by these special people. By personal favorite is 83 year old surfer "Woody" Brown pictured with his 6 year old son Woody Jr. (Yep.... do the math) A copy of their picture is posted on my refrigerator for those days I hesitate to lace up the running shoes.
Example: [An energizing routine, led by Brazilian dance and fitness instructor Vanessa Isaac] Brazilian Dance Workout is a high-energy cardio-workout DVD for all fitness levels, inspired by the exciting rhythms of Brazilian dance. Samba, Samba Reggae, Axe, African and Frevo moves blend in an energizing routine, led by Brazilian dance and fitness instructor Vanessa Isaac. Bonus audio tracks include a Brazilian percussion mix and the "Hip Brazil" theme by Randy Tico. An enthusiastically toe-tapping addition to personal fitness library and exercise routine DVD shelves, highly recommended for men and women of all ages looking for motivation to get moving and healthy. 60 min., color.
Example: [Should be zero stars] Bought after Thanksgiving as a Christmas present for my daughter. Opened on Christmas morning with what we thought were dead batteries, I tried 3 different sets of brand new batteries and the cash register just flat does not work. I've been trying to initiate a return through Amazon for 3 days now, and every time I get to the return page the site freezes up. Hopefully when Amazon gets their return page working, they will allow a return after their 30 day limit, or I will never order anything from them again.**1/8/13 Finally able to log in to Amazon for a return, printed return labels w\out problem, hopefully they will refund without an issue as well.
Example: [Life on the Other Side Review] Sylvia Browne does an excellant job describing exactly what the title inferes, Life on the Other Side. Anyone even remotely interested in what Heaven is like, should read this amazing book. Sylvia explanins how she "knows what she knows" Skeptics will be convinced, and believers will nod in agreement. Sylvia uses humor and biblical references to back up her beliefs, and I, for one, am looking forward to returning home.
Example: [Scratched Discs. Someone should be flogged] The others reviews about scratched disks are right on the money. I had no idea, and hadn't read any reviews before I bought. Do NOT buy the Limited Edition version, unless they repackage it. Shameful that they put out such a poor product design for such a huge release. What a fiasco. Both my discs were rolling around inside and all scratched up. I hope Best Buy doesn't give me a problem with the return. I'm sure the game itself is 5 star. This edition of it is 1 star.
Example: [Are you kidding???] I purchased this item on June 21. It was great for, um, a month and 10 days. Now it is no longer working. That is crazy.
Example: [Unstoppable leaks began about 2 weeks after installation] As is typical (unfortunately) with on-tap water filters, and threaded parts seem to be made of soft plastic. This unit was fine the first day, but after using it for a week or so, the leaks began, spraying water in all directions whenever you try to use filter. And if you bump the filter, it falls off the faucet. I didn't even get through the first filter before I had to give it up as a bad job.Don't get this one. It's as bad as the Brita.
Example: [a very bad book] This is a very bad book, it's full of stupid questions and dumb explanations, e.g. the 3rd math multiple question of the 2nd section of the first of two practice exam did not even contain the answer for the question, and the explanation to the question is an error. .
Example: [One disc, 16 hits.] I do realize there's the 2-disc "Chronicles" collection, as well as others, but being a minor fan this made the most sense to me. It has most everything you've heard on the radio (hence the title), plus some. Included is "Fly By Night", "Closer To The Heart", "Freewill", "New World Man", and the popular "Tom Sawyer". Plus it ends with my favorite "Time Stand Still", with guest vocals from "Aimee Mann". The only thing I wish they had fit on is "Show Don't Tell", from the album "Presto". Some copies of this came with a bonus DVD with lyrics and 5 videos too. Overall, these songs are a real "Rush", and it's a great collection for the casual fan.
Example: [Who are these people?] This book is a good read. It has forbiden sex and suspense. But it has it's flaws. The protagonist, Ted Swenson is a creative writing professor at a small New England college. One of his criteria for good writing is that the characters have to be believable. It is interesting to apply his principles to the novel itself. Swenson comes off as quite believable, but his nemisis, Angela Argo is not. Her destructive actions have no conceivable motive. She is too clever and her timing is too acurate to suppose that she is psychotic. Likewise, the campus atmosphere is not like anything I have ever seen(for example, the English Department party), and while sex between faculty and students has become no-no, the description of the faculty meeting on this subject is an unbelievable exageration of the PC attitudes that prevail. What saves the book is the portrayal of Swenson. I have met him - many of him. And there are parts of himin every middleaged man.
Example: [Another good one.] Just as enjoyable as the first book. It's a pleasure to be reading a book that you look forward to picking up. Great and uplifting characters.
Example: [Excellent] This book has TONS of useful information from birth to death. Really is a resource to save!!
Example: [Terrible Film. Do Not Waste Your Time or Money!] This was hands down the most pointless, boring movie I have ever seen. I went to see this film simply because Clint Eastwood has been making very good movies lately. I figured that this film would more of the same of his work.This movie was slow, boring, and lacked substance. It made you believe that within the next scene or the scene after that, something would happen to make the movie interesting. This film was so poorly done that I decided to wait for friends in the lobby of the theater instead of enduring any more of this film.Do yourself a favor, do not watch this film. You will waste money and more importantly, time.
Example: [Great Video!!! – Worth Every Penny!!!] I received this just recently and found the video to be very detailed and provided everything I needed to take care of my AR 15. In addition, they went over a bit of history regarding the AR and also explained the ammunition used in the AR. If you are looking for a video that will explain the details of how your AR rifle works I would recommend this product 100%!!!! Excellent!!!!!
Example: [It's Ok] This book is only ok. The images are interesting to my 2-month baby, but not as exciting to him asLook, Look!. The animals are nice, but they don't provide as much inspiration for conversation asHello, Animals! (Black and White Sparklers). Overall, ok, but it rarely comes off the book shelf.
Example: [First movie I ever walked out on] Never in my 34 years have I ever walked out on a movie, but I did with Amelia. So I guess you should take this review with a grain of salt since I only saw about 45 minutes of the movie. But man were those 45 minutes BAD!!! I usually like Hilary Swank, but her acting in this movie was just...weird - as if Amelia Earhart had Assberger's or something. Her acting was so stilted and wooden that it was really hard to relate to the character. There's no way anyone actually talks that way, unless there's something wrong with them.As for the story itself...it just didn't go anywhere - or if it did eventually, it took longer than 45 minutes. I can't really say much more about it because I can't even remember what happened in those 45 minutes, either because nothing in particular happened, or it was so bad that I blocked it out. This movie was so bad it almost makes it worth watching to marvel at its badness...but not quite.
Example: [return this now] Allstar Baseball 2003 was terrible. ASB2001 was the best of all. It was too hard to hit the ball even on rookie mode. The instruction manual told me nothing. It was so overrated. Too little gameplay and the person who made this game should be fired and thrown out on the street.
Example: [I have never tried an anti-perspirant before (only ...] I have never tried an anti-perspirant before (only deodorants) and so I was a little worried about skin reactions, but all was well. I liked the product. It has a good (not overpowering) smell, and my wife likes the smell, too, which is a VERY good thing. One difference between this and other similar products is the scent, which is more like a cologne than a deodorant. If that's what you're looking for, then that would be a significant advantage. I would recommend this product to friends and family.
Example: [A Bitter Wind Blows] I've made several comments against bitterant on other air dusters and in the end I went with this one because there weren't any comments (at the time) stating whether or not it included it or not and nothing in the description at that time noting its presence either. Its no surprise now (as other reviewers have commented) that I got "bit." Yes the product contains bitterant, but not to a degree that I could detect from smell, though others may be more sensitive to its smell than myself. Aside from that it does do the job it is supposed to do, initially. The air pressure drops after a few sprays and it becomes all but ineffective. I ordered two packs (4 cans) and the result was always the same. I'd bought a different brand at Staples about a year ago, that really did the job down to the last spray, but of course they were out of it at the time. One could definitely do better than this.
Example: [Well-written, repulsive] I almost stopped reading this book when one of the main characters went mad and began consuming his own excrement. If this doesn't put you off, perhaps you could overcome a natural revulsion and enjoy the author's excellent writing style. I couldn't. Be warned that this book does not end by giving the reader an uplifting feeling. The writing is powerful enough that you won't be able to forget it; personally, I sincerely regret that.
Example: [nice collection] This book is wonderful. I personally loved Curious George as a kid and I wanted to pass those stories along to my son, and what better way than all the original stories in one book! It takes up so much less space and costs much less than buying each book separately. Well worth the money.
Example: [Good Product] I bought this mp3 player so I could download music from napster. I use it at the gym, run it thru the radio in my car and hook it up to speakers and listen to music at work.The only complaint I have is that sometimes you have to keep hitting buttons to get where you want on the menu. Other than that, I'm very happy with the player's performance.
Example: [Lovely children's book] If I could I'd give this to all new parents. This story of little creatures who can't let themselves fall asleep out of fear of missing something will sound familiar to anyone who's tried to put a reluctant child to sleep. But the real take-away is how the blind snake Kartusch teaches these little ones to appreciate their world on a deeper level and how to develop inner peace. Of course children aren't born knowing these things, the sooner they learn them the happier they'll be!
Example: [Non classic boys choir] This music is haunting. I was inspired by the film Chorus and promptly searched for a recording and was grateful to find it on Amazon. The original music is beautifully performed by Les Petites Chanteurs de Saint-Marc choir with the inspired voice of the solist Jean-Baptiste Maunier. The words are inspiring and original as well; although in French, there is a translation in the little booklet accompanying the CD. "Look to your path," my favorite song says, "Children lost, forgotten, give them a hand to lead them to other tomorrows." I also recommend the film which is a brilliant study in leadership, humanity and warmth.
Example: [happy with purchase] i am very happy with the eureka boss, the price was very affordable, the attachments are easy to use. i have used it on wood floors also and its better than sweeping. the foot pedal to lower it into position to vacuuum is a little stiff and hard to depress. i would recommend buying this vacuum
Example: [One of the worst books EVER] Hard to believe this was written by the author of the masterful 'Water for Elephants' in fact I don't believe it! How could it be???This was such an awful book I kept thinking there was some type of trick up the author's sleeve. But alas, it really was just a bad book.Read the other 1-star reviews, they are all true, accurate and honest. The book is unbelievably maddening and the main character, Annemarie, sickening.I loved 'Water for Elephants' but will NEVER waste my time reading another Sara Gruen book. I feel as if someone cheated me out of a portion of my life. If it wasn't for the fact that I had a Book on CD version, I could never have gotten through it.Yuck!!!
Example: [Don't buy it] The product comes with zero support. In order to get any support on the product you have to purchase a separate support contract.EDIT: I wanted to be sure I pointed out that the reseller of this product, Dominant Systems, is excellent. I had a problem with registration of the product and they promptly helped me correct the issue. Unfortunately the product itself is not something I'd buy again, but it's not Domninant Systems fault in any way.
Example: [Logitech Cordless Rumblepad 2 with Vibration Feedback] This item does not work with any of the new games, had to send it back for a refund.
Example: [Crazy Taxi] A very satisfying game. If your thinking of buying it, don't, just go buy it now. If you have played the arcade version, just add an extra stage, optional time limits andd the crazy box and you get Crazy Taxi for Dreamcast. Buy it. Its one of those games that you actually want to play after a month.
Example: [editing outdated] Focus on Pronunciation 1 (Book & CD)The book now has a new version. This version is no longer used by teachers. Not changed, nor returned because it is not worth. The cost of postage is high, but I would get my money in credit or discount on amazon.com
Example: [Gallager, you were the greatest] I remember Gallager while I was growin up. Tried to go see him several times in Atlanta, Ga and Charlottee, NC, and could not get tickets. I did see him several time on HBO specials. He is so funny is his own way. So now I have part of his collection.
Example: [Very cheap plastic game] The game didn't work when we received it and calling customer support did get us a new one. It's all plastic, really easy to break. There's a switch that counts clicks when you turn the board. Some chip in there keeps track and our 'chip' was bad according to customer support. If your kids will use it for one or two times, then you should be fine. We got a replacement and it worked for a day.
Example: [Excellent early warning system] Now we know when someone is approaching our house...one beep for the driveway, two beeps at the front door, three beeps means the back door and four beeps means the back yard. We are never surprised.
Example: [Great trap...but be forewarned] This trap did its job perfectly on the first night trying to trap a pesky raccoon. I used crumbled bacon and at 4am I awoke to a HUGE (even the animal control guy was shocked by the size) raccoon shaking the cage trying to escape. What I wasn't prepared for was the huge mess the raccoon created! Fecal matter everywhere...pee everywhere...and shredded cardboard everywhere(I hid the cage under a cardboard box not knowing the raccoon would be able to reach through the cage and shred it. Don't forget to check with your state's Dept. of Natural Resources before trapping (you need a permit in MD and many other states). I really felt bad for the raccoon but I am happy not to have him waking me up every night trying to rip my trash cans to shreds to get inside.
Example: [Do not waste your money!] O.k. This is another one of those deceptive DVD's. You think that there will be interaction between the "Sorority Girls" but in reality what you get are 6 single ten minute nude portfolios of average looking women. The DVD could have been called "Tepid, desperate women looking for employment." No relation to sororities at all. The women are o.k. looking - some with tattoos, some with piercings, and the photography is fine - more explicit than Playboy, less explicit than Penthouse. Bottom line = very, very boring. You've been warned. Don't make the mistake I did. Save your $15.00 on something else.
Example: [Great game for a 3yr old!] My daughter got Click Start for Christmas and the past two days it has been all she has wanted to play with, she loves it and it has been great for her. Yesterday she couldn't operate it herself but today she can accurately move the mouse and she has only played it an hour total both days! I am very pleased with this purchase. The only thing I can think will be a negative is that there are very few games for it, we have two because the other ones didn't really appeal to us, it'd be great if they came out with more games.
Example: [groundbreaking] This book was the first of its kind and caused uproar within the British police ranks when it was first published in 1993. Based on the author's PhD research with anonymous officers, the book contains both a semi-academic introduction to each issue but consists mostly of edited interviews with gay and lesbian police officers that are easy and interesting reading. The combination of Burke's socio-psychological observations along with the spoken word, make this book compelling and it remains a must read for all police officers and anyone else who still mis-understands what it really means to be gay.
Example: [My controller] My controller didnt charge when connected with the cord available and the pins were partially bent when i took a closer look. Will have to buy another charger (probably the docking one). The controller was scratched but other than that, i got what i wanted, which was another controller and it works.
Example: [The Aims of Argument] The book came in before school started (Kudos) and was in very good shape. It came via United Parcel Service, and I always like that because the United States Postal Service always drags their feet, and the carriers do not pay attention to the mail they actually deliver (every book that has been sent via USPS I have had to call the Postmaster to find it).I appreciate your promptness and hope to do business with you again.
Example: [Uhhhh!] Why are we forced to read some of the most boring books in the world!?! Here's the setup. A mother abandons her children in a car so the children decide to go from Rhode Island to Conneticutt(or is it the other way around?) Sounds interesting right? Well it isn't. Most of the time the book's talking about their walk to their destination. My opinion is that this is a bad book.
Example: [Duct tape and bubble gum] Had the sole coming apart after 155 miles of trail. Used super glue to hold them together for another section of the AT. Keen, you gotta be kidding me! Everything else about the boot is fine, but to lose it's basic function on account of glue? Just stupid!
Example: [kiss the future is the future now!!!dub!!!!] this completely blew me away. i;ve never been a on u sound or mark stewart completist . for me this hits the best dub moments of stewart's career. i've read reviews that say this isn't complete enough. how could it be, stewart's been around awhile. still, the dubbed out tracks on here make you realize the dub genius of adrian sherwood and mark stewart. the pop group really updated dub in the era of the late 70's. stewart continued and continues to break ground in the area of distorted-in your face- dub productions. from track 1 - 12 i had a huge smile on my face!
Example: [Excelente cd..maravilloso sonido!!!] ESte cd de John Coltrane es realmente una maravilla. Encontramos aquí a un grandioso maestro del jazz que con profundidad y virtuosismo nos presenta una selección de temas que contienen la quintaesencia del jazz. Este maravilloso saxofonista tenor nos trae el recuerdo de otro grande del bebop como fue Charlie Parker. Los 05 temas son bellísimos, destacando las dos baladas: "I Want To Talk About You" y el homenaje al fallecido saxofonista de Dizz "Theme For Ernie". Maravillosa improvisación en el tema "Russian Lullaby".Una verdadera joya del jazz que apreciamos en una excelente presentación en LP sleeve y una magnífica remasterización.
Example: [Punk Guru Is Weak!] Claw Hammer is not A 90's Punk Band.To compare them to NOFX A Kiddie Punk Band is nonsense.I've seen Claw Hammer and the talent they have is above and beyond anything NOFX could put out!Pablum Rocks, and I'm sure Bad Religon feels the same way.(Guru My ASS!!!)
Example: [Very disappointed] I am very disappointed with this item. I bought it for my granddaughter and initially loved the set. It was beautiful but upon actual use of it in the crib, it began to tear at the seams and fray all over. It is unsafe to even have it in the crib. It is definitely pretty but not worth it if you can't use it.
Example: [Dad knows!] Like the fist one this was a delight to read. Some more insight into Anna's world and the way she experiance God. I loved it!
Example: [Broken] I used the Cebrax MP3 play less than 5 minutes and its display quit working. A few phone calls later we found out that we needed to return the player and get it replaced. Maybe the replacement will last longer...
Example: [It does rain in S.CA!] What a great song on a pretty darn good cd. This is TTT's best cd, anniversary is their best song, but this is by far their best cd!
Example: [Not getting the product] I never received the item. I waited and waited for the shipment. I contacted the seller, but got not answer. I wish Amazon would be certain of the seller's commitment to fulfill an order. I wasted a lot of time waiting for the product. This seller should be banned!
Example: [Display Stopped Working] After less than one year of use, the display for the clock stopped working. When I called RCA to complain and get a replacement, they told me they had no record of my warrantee submission, and that they would do nothing for me without a receipt. Either keep your receipt or look for another product.
Example: [Old cliches put into a new format, or not so new.] Slow begining. A bunch of stuff already done before. . .over all, I wouldn't say it's a terrible book, it was okay. This will not go down in history as one of George Lucas's greater creations, not even really in the GOOD catagory. It's just another book about a race of people who have slaves and one of them decides to break free from thier evil ways. I wouldn't recremend this to you people out there who like alot of space-faring action, or like anything face paced, because this is not the book for you.
Example: [Don't waste your money] I seldom write a review like this one, but trust me when I say this was a total waste. This is not only a waste of money it's a waste of plastic. The switches don't lock, you usualy tell when they are in the down position,and the pin sockets are so weak that they drop the connection. It wasn't worth the price of shipping or I would have sent it back instead of tossing it.
Example: [Almost a perfect product] It's light ... it's adjustable ... it's affordable. I only wish you could tilt the pedal as well as raise it up and down. That would make it perfect.
Example: [Absolutely Useless] Don't bother to buy this. The instructions are like trying to read a translation from Japanese assembly instructions for some incomprehensible machine. I was totally unable to translate his instructions into any usefull movement. For example he says, "With both your elbows pointing 45 digrees at the dance floor relax your underarms and push the upper arms up by flexing all the muscles that surround the front, side, and back of your rib cage." I don't know about you but this instruction is useless for me.I am currently using this book as a hot-pad in my kitchen.
Example: [track listing] 1. Tiny Meat (original version)2. Tiny Meat (danny saber mix)3. Heidi (scream team mix)Austrian Import.1995 Creation Records Limited
Example: [Disappointing] I had never heard of Cornelius but I was intrigued and thought I would give this a shot. I was looking for some neat video/animation together with some interesting music. With the hopes of being pleasantly surprised I ordered my copy. I must say that I was disappointed in the music as well as most of the videos. The sound is excellent but the only decent video here, in my opinion, is drop. Most of the music is really corny and the last video is plain horrible. If your really interested try to rent this before you spend your money!
Example: [wireless on a PDA] Easy enough to use, install the software and plug it in.There are a couple of small issues with it though:When setting it up, the field for the network id on a WEP connection will not let you enter a long value. It appears to run out of space, at least it stops accepting characters. You have to write it elsewhere and cut/past it in.The power management is poor. The power management setting of on (or even auto) drains the battery. The manual is no help, just repeatedly stating:Power Management is a power saving mode. The lower power consumption may also lower the wireless performance. To enable Power Management, select On. To disable Power Management, select Off.The power LED stay on, even when the PDA hibernates. I have to remove the card to prevent this.
Example: [The thin blue review] Rowan Atkinson, TV's Mr Bean and Blackadder had another show that ran for 2 seasons in england and this is it. Not as great as the other shows but a good solid comedy with Rowan Atkinson doing another type of role. He might have been the star of the show but he was more of a straight man to the crazy crew.
Example: [not recommended] This is more a compendium of the author's prejudices and rantings, defensively rendered, than a book about arranging. All the examples are from his own works--he is not recognized as a significant composer. I learned much more from "Inside the Score" by Rayburn Wright, and I recommend this book instead.Also recommended: PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST by JEFF BURNS.
Example: [Album of the Year] Here it is folks, after a 7 year hiatus, the Wrens we know and love are back...or are they? Well, the truth is they're certainly back, but they've changed much since Secaucus. The first thing you'll noticed is they've lost a bit of the edginess on display in Secaucus. Instead of up-beat, immediately catchy pop tunes, the Wrens sound has matured into down-beat, immediately heart-wrenching songs of failure and endless breakups. As a result, with Meadowlands, the Wrens have reached a new emotional level not only in their own work, but in their genre as well. When "Happy" blessed my ears for the first time, I knew then that this is the best album of 2003. Don't pass this album up, you'll be sorry you did.
Example: [Don't be tempted by the novelty...] Like many others here, the unit did NOT work right out of the box! The Check Tank button repeatedly lit, despite following all the "tips" for addressing the problem. Finally sat on the floor next to it, hitting Power, Power, Clean everytime the check tank button lit. After 20-30 button hit cycles, it finally started up. Lets see, its 11 pm now, it started cleaning 2 hours ago. I figure by morning the kitchen, (less than 100 sq feet!) might finally be cleaned! If I had gotten off my backside, I could have swept and mopped the kitchen, and vacuumed and shampooed the living room carpet! Steer clear of this useless "toy."
Example: [too far-out for me] I love books like this, and thought I would love Vast (my first Nagata). But I had to put it down after about 25% of the way through. The characters were all so alien, that I couldn't relate to any of them. The "hard-science" was so futuristic, that it wasn't even plausible -- and no attempt to explain it. I can't recommend this book, but I will try other books by Nagata and hope this was just a fluke. :-)
Example: [I love Tango] I loved this video. Maybe because I love Argentine Tango. There is so much individuality expressed by each of the eight couples, that it seems like Tango has no limits. This dance is for everyone. It has everything to satisfy anybody's taste. The quality of dancers in this show is world-class. It is hard to imagine how it can get much better, but somehow I believe that most of these couples have not reached their peaks yet. Marvelous video!
Example: [A hard blow to psuedoscience] Pretty much a book that dissects human beliefs and offers rational explanation for everything. It takes the fun out of things like alien invasions and ghosts, but it makes the reader more informed. Good for people who want scientific explanation for everything, but a harsh reality check for those who engage in more whimsical and alternative belief systems.
Example: [late shipping] I ordered this CD on June 30 and it is now Aug 7 and it has not shipped yey - promised date missed twice - now saying it will ship Aug 23. I would not buy from them again.
Example: [Adjustable width but VERY thin plastic vinyl window shade] I bought this item for my classroom since I couldn't find the correct width of a shade anywhere else. In the instructions to have the shade fit the window, the roller was adjustable and the shade was able to be torn to fit the roller. It attached then to the roller with double sided tape already on the roller. But the shade was so thin, that just attaching it to the roller, made it rip more. Room Darkening??? No, way.... It does say "Economy" on the package. Maybe there are different levels of room darkening. I don't feel for the price that I received an equal quality item.
Example: [Why do Leaves Change color?] It is a very educational book. I am not sure though that the age range is correct. I think It may be hard for a 4 year old to all take in. There is quite the detail about information we only learn in our later years.
Example: [The Body Smart System, a true life saver] I first used this diet nine years ago and it has changed my life. I lost lots of weight,my allergies disappeared and my thyroid problem disappeared. I plan to order this book for my relatives in hopes that they can also be helped.
Example: [Groovy] This book is a really fun read. If you like Bruce Campbell, don't miss it. If you don't like Bruce Campbell, get yourself checked out. Enjoy!
Example: [Spiritual Gift] Dr. Wayne Dyer is a man who is spiritually grounded and he shares his knowledge in this book. It was a good read and a quick one but one that you will go back to time and again.
Example: [watched it a second time and i realized...] this movie stinks, annoying acting, stupid ending beyond belief...special features are non-existint dont be sucked in to that (2 movie versions crap) it's not just a different ending which sucks horribly....worth and rent thats it..
Example: [Many Questions] This book had many strong moments as well as weak moments. The points it tries-to- make at times were hard to follow.
Example: [Community Organizing and Social Activism Essentials] This book is particularly good for understanding the relationships between the organizer/facilitator and the grass roots community activists, for understanding what can be done during down times when social movements are least active, and for understanding the role of education in the transformation of society.
Example: [Good product] This is a good product the only problem is it is a bit messy. The juice leaks from the top and drains down on the side. This is the best buy for your money.
Example: [The third-best Star Trek movie ever!] The movie suffers a bit from a tight budget (ckeck out Valaris sliding down a ladder and hitting a bulkhead. The whole wall shakes. But all that aside this is the one of the strongest Trek films only bettered by II and First Contact. The principles of Star Trek are closely adhered to and the Cast Autograph sign off at the end of the movie was a GREAT way to end the last trek movie to have the complete old-series cast. This movie will not disappoint in the least and will keep you on the edge of your seat through the final act.
Example: [where is this all going?] one of the few books that I could not finish.In fact I couldn't stand it any longer. The author(of stayed in India(?) for some time tries desperately to infuse the 'indian ethos or culture' into the book unsuccessfully. The attempt is really lame. Being an Indiphile does not help when you're trying to read this one.sorry. 1 star.
Example: [Very cool,] This was an interesting movie. It takes ALOT to scare me when I watch Horrors, this one was so plot thickened that it ALMOST scared me. It kind of reminded me of the Abyss, which is't scary and really had nothing to do with this. But none the less, It is a Carpenter movie, and it is a MUST see!
Example: [Tropical Getaway is the perfect read!] Wow!! I really loved this book. The story is fast paced and keeps you riveted from page one. Dane is an AWESOME hero. Very sexy, and some of his lines made me shiver. I loved him. Ava is fun and fiesty. Her brother, Marco's story line is beautifully done. I definately recommend Tropical Getaway and can't wait to read Roxanne St. Claire's next book.
Example: [Sucky bottles] These bottles are the worst I've ever seen. My son could not get latched on correctly, the nipples were too small, and then when he drank from them it went down way to quickly. And why should a bottle be so complicated that you have to either hold it just right or screw the lid on just right, not to tight you know. Who wants to mess with that in the middle of the night. We switched to the playtex natural latch and everything was much better. Yes you have the bags, but there is no leaking and no extra air. I only use these bottle with my pump and even then they are a pain in the butt, because they don't want to stay screwed to the pump. ERRR!! Very frustrating.
Example: [Great Movie] This movie mirrors real life and then hands it over to the audience for resolution. You will be pleased with this picture.
Example: [This album will bring you back...] My husband and I attended both high school and college in the 80s, resulting in us being huge fans of the decade's music for life--we even had all 80s music at our recent wedding! This album is part of our vast 80s music collection; it's such a must-have that we bought a replacement when our old CD player destroyed our original copy. The songs wil take you back both to the movie and to the decade, starting with the title track, "Pretty in Pink," a huge mainstream hit by a non-mainstream group, the Psycedelic Furs. Other hits from the album include OMD's "If You Leave" and "Left of Center" by Suzanne Vega. My favorite, however, is "Wouldn't it Be Good," a Nik Kershaw tune nicely covered here by the Danny Hutton Hitters. Finally, fans of more obscure 80s groups such as New Order are likely to enjoy the remaining songs on this tape. For the sake of both nostalgia and the music itself, this album is a must-have addition to any 80s collection.
Example: [It's cute ^_^] I bought this CD when I was like 14 (I'm 18 now), and I still enjoy listening to it. Basically, it's "cute" - the songs are from the first season of Sailor Moon. I've been wanting the songs like "Oh Starry Night" and "My Only Love" ever since I heard them on the show, and I was so excited to hear that they came out with a CD. I like almost all of the songs, except for maybe one or two. Bonus: you get the lyrics, which is useful, because there were some lines I wasn't sure about. I recommend it for young girls, and anyone who enjoys watching the show. I think the soundtrack really goes well with the dubbed show, and I think shows need soundtracks to make them more memorable. It's a shame they didn't make more songs for the other seasons.
Example: [LOUD!] This fan is everything as advertised - and more. The oscillating feature is SO LOUD, it make this fan impractical for a bedroom. I would recommend this product - but only in its non-oscillating mode!
Example: [Terrific Product] After much looking I found this the Lenox on Line. It is by far the best Ice Bucket we have owned and several of our friends were so impressed they too have purchased it. Strongly recommend.
Example: [Amazing, as usual] Yu Watase never fails to deliver, and this book is no exception. Dramatic, enticing, eloquent, heart-wrenching, beautifully tragic. What more can I say? Yu Watase does push some emotional buttons here, taking her well-developed characters to the max and putting them in situations that show their true colors(especially Yuhi...read the book, and you'll see what I mean). If you've seen the anime and think you don't need to read the manga, you're completely wrong...So much was left out of the tv series...The characters really are taken to a whole new level(especially Shuro,in my opinion(but that's another book, not this one...). Please check this out. I can guaruntee you will NOT be dissappointed, maybe a little depressed...Just prepare yourself for angst and turmoil^^;!
Example: [One word. Greedo.] The word Greedo can sum up two major points of these dvds.1. He does NOT shoot first. Why would Lucas feel the need to change this? And Greedo must have had one too many Cantina drinks if he could miss from a distance of 1 foot...2. Greedo - o = greed.Lucas and his Special Editions, terrible new trilogy, edits, etc, are nothing but a chance to milk the franchise dry. Leave the classics alone! Isnt the Skywalker ranch big enough?
Example: [Radiohead stinks] If you like radiohead your stupid. Lol. You are probably some really dumb boso college student who trys to act rebbellious and just listens to radiohead for the hell of it. Dont get this... this is their worst album which is just sad. Radiohead stinks!
Example: [Tennis Balls As Good As Dryer Balls! And Less $$!] I did a little test while I was visiting my Daughter-In-Law, who possesses not only Dryer Balls, but a nice supply of tennis balls. For the test I washed two feather pillows from our motor home, which had become musty during storage. I washed them separately, each with a towel to balance the load. After washing, I dried each set with a dryer sheet in addition to the balls, mostly for fragrance: one set of pillow and towel with the dryer balls and one set with two tennis balls. Both thumped noisily around in the dryer and both walloped the feather pillows and towels back to equal fluffiness. I had considered purchasing dryer balls, but my daughter-in-law contributed the two test tennis balls and I am have been perfectly happy with the results.
Example: [I've got to get home to that good pie.] An astronomer, Dan Aykroyd as Steve Mills, by way of a fluke, sends a message out of the galaxy. This causes a gravitational instability on that quadrant. An alien embassary, Kim Basinger as Celeste Martin, is sent to find and correct the problem. She is accompanied by Bag (Ann Prenttiss) who is ready to destroy anyone that gets in the way.There are lots of misunderstandings and sight gages. However the Alien learns of love and people (including Jimmy Durante). This movie is just too jam-packed with fun to describe. You will have to see it again and again to pick up the parts that went by too fast.
Example: [Great deal] Best price I could find, exactly what I needed and it arrived so quickly I didn't have time to track it!!!
Example: [Easily my favorite router ever] I love this router. I've purchased, hacked, and installed at least 30 of these things, and there simply isn't a better , more reliable router on the market.With the stock configuration, this router still edges out the competition, but once you replace the firmware it blows everything else out of the water with ease. Not even close.The most basic replacement firmware (Tomato) gives you as much functionality in this router as high-end equipment. I can do some pretty cool stuff with it, the most basic of which is boost the wireless signal strength by about 300%.
Example: [Gripping, Fascinating legal arguments] A good whodunnit for holiday reading. Not the best of this author's books that I hacve read. Lacks the depth of research apparent in such books as In the name of honour.
Example: [You need to have this books] This is a outstanding source that you need in the study of the biblcal world.
Example: [Only one good thing about this book] There is only one thing surrounding this book that is any good.... The five star reviews on here. I suggest reading them as they are filled with delusional and hilarious posts. On a side note, yes there is a Church of Satan, you can even visit their website, but they just worship another make believe entity. What's the difference?
Example: [Not impressed] Thought this would be a good way to avoid bloody fingers when slicing onions. Hard to push into onions and does not make consistent slices. I usually only got 2-3 decent slices per attempt so I no longer even bother to try to use it to slice an onion. I would like to be fair though and state that it does an ok job for thin tomato slices. That's the only thing that hss kept it out of the trash can. Only rated 1 star because it is listed as an onion holder.
Example: [water from a stone] how much money needs to be made on the fan of these fantastic movies? this product is a disrespectful, cynical installment in the continuing rip-off of the fan--shameful. the director's cuts will be the next release--that should have been this release--do not buy.
Example: [not a good price, for a mediocar product.] Cabinet LEDs work better, are slimmer and brighter (dimable by tape, plastic film or dimmer switch.)two of these barely lit my 30 gallon. was not happy with them.
Example: [Signs of the times...] This book illustrates, with some technical form, the artful, whimsical commercial signage of days past. If you're wistful or nostalgic about the wild neon and bright painted signage you saw or like from the golden ages of the fifties and sixties, this book is for you! It's chock full of signage, specs and discussions of the form and substance of fanciful advertising. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves the imagery found all along the Mother Road..and beyond!
Example: [No rocking as your rolling along] I purchased this item for my husband who travels every week with his job. He likes it because it's more convenient than the window mount, and it stays put.Since it fits easily in his briefcase, he not only uses it in his own car, he also takes it with him on business trips all over the country. He's very happy with it, and has already recommended it to friends and colleagues.
Example: [One song worth it all] This song alone is worth the price of the CD: A Hundred Thousand Angels - Bliss
Example: [Works Great] Great Product. I use Windows 7 and it works great. I do not use the sleep function or Hibernate on ether one of my computers so it is not a problem.
Example: [TOO BOUNCY] Could NOT stop bouncing--took over four minutes just to stop bouncying. Hit my head on ceiling--familiy say sI'm not nearly the same. Handle won't come off so you can't store it probably. Also, my cat hates blue. HATES IT. Very angry. Did not come in any soft tones--ridickoulusl. Is not pet safe--TOO BOUNCY. Next time don't go with rubber.
Example: [movie] Bought this for my 10 year old daughter - she is not interested in it. Haven't made it all the way through movie - lost interest and did something else.
Example: [smooth and silky] I bought it for my wife and she says it is the best product of its type she has used. She has tried them all and thinks this is best.
Example: [The Beatles remixed and reworked into a beautiful sound collage!!! Groovy baby!!!] Great job Sir George Martin and son Giles for remixing and reworking these timeless classics into a beautiful,colourful soung collage for the mind!!!,and of course the Beatles(John Paul,George and Ringo) themselves for creating such timeless music that will live on for eternity!!! It's been reworked but it works here in spades!!! Just pop in Love in the CD player and enjoy the Beatles as never before!!! They might have broke up ions ago but the music live on!!! It's groovy baby,Austin Powers would love this!!!Two thumbs up!!! Way Up!!! A+
Example: [Not the same quality as Cave Bear or Valley of Horses] I read "Mammoth Hunters" after "Clan of Cave Bear" and "The Valley of the Horses" hoping to get something similar, but I just found in "Mammoth Hunters" some kind of love & jellousy novel running in prehistoric times. This book is not as fresh, as precedents, it is not as interesting as precedents and it is not as good as precedents. Characters of both "lovers" are not well design, character of Ayla becomes soft and, so to say, wishy-washy, rhythm becomes slow and imagination falls to none. Before reading "Mammoth Hunters" I bought "Plains of Passage", after reading it I have not found courage enough to read "PoP".
Example: [A Steaming Pile of Crap] If there was an option for zero stars, that is what I would award this "book." To point out all of the flaws, inaccuracies, and blatant falsehoods in this book would take up nearly as much space as the book itself occupies. I wholeheartedly agree with a previous reviewer that if one is not intellectualy ready for Liber ABA, then that person is not ready for ceremonial magick. This book panders to idiots and is a disgrace to Crowley's name.
Example: [Foam Sleeve for the shop vacuum cleaner] The sleeve is the perfect fit and worked fine. Mostly, i used it to vacuum wet areas. It is not as strudy as I would like it to be, but, for it's price point it is OK ...
Example: [BRUTAL] What a mess! This game stinky inky inks inks and that is my honest and most friendly opinion of this game. It doesn't even dip into the grand theft auto pool. This is a uneven, unfinished, and unfun game. I WARN YOU ONCE TO STAY AWAY
Example: [Hard to play] This is EASY game??? WOW~!!! This is HARD game for me. WHY? Because it does not let me control the players too well....and players move too slow for how I want them to play. May be I need a manual booklet since I purchased this item solo without manual. I have been playing hundreds of hrs, but never has been able to win any matches. I select 5/5 team against 2/5 team, and I still get beat. It plays with my eye site? I can not see where ball is going to be and whre I need to move players to, etc. I also do not know how to control the PK, or simple shot in the way I want it to go......VERY IRRITATING to play since I can not control the players the way I want them to play........
Example: [Do not order this shovel] I have used this shovel for only two N.Y. snow storms and it is already wearing through. The wear strip is mounted on the inside of the shovel. Thus the bottom of the shovel beneath the metal wear strip is wearing out. This shovel will not last one season. I have other suncast shovels which have the wear strip on both sides of the shovel. These products last longer. The shovel that I recommend is Suncast SC2700 20-Inch Snow Shovel/Pusher Combo with Wear Strip And D-Grip Handle.
Example: [Didn't fit my needs] This product did not fit my need of transporting Lantus and Aphidra pens. The plastic inside was stiff and not convenient for me. I returned it.
Example: [This is about alternate history --- at the meta level --- too rarefied for me] I knew that Niall would talk about alt history, but I was sore disappointed that he didn't describe or excerpt or analyze any specific examples. I knew he would mention alt history --- but I was dismayed to discover he failed to USE it.
Example: [Does Not Work] When I try to build a room on the ship, it crashes my Windows 2000 Computer. Looked at their site for maybe some updates or FAQs, but there are none. This is being returned.
Example: [I bought this book I while back when we were starting a antique bottle collection.] It helps know the value when we can look it up in a book. We don't want to over pay when making bids on line.
Example: [DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT] I was tempted to buy this product as it was reasonably priced and seemed to support what I needed. After I got this product it did not work - the software could not detect the unit on the network. I troubleshooted the problem with IOGEAR technical support and was told that the unit was defective and I should return it. Thinking that this can happen once, I ordered a replacement unit. Guess what? this one did not work as well. The same exact problem - the unit did not get an ip and therefore was not detected. Again customer support and again I was told to return the unit. I am not buying an IOGEAR again.
Example: [GOOD] OKay, when i told my friends I had bought this sailor moon movie, they were all like "Oh, all the other ones are better..." and stuff like that. I thought that this one was really good, but they were right. The other ones are better. that doesn't mean I'm putting this one down or anything. this movie is totally awesome. I loved it. in the end, it made me wanna cry. I mean Luna was awesome... I wished it aws real life. It's kinda is a remake of the Berly seen. I mean come on, the silver crystal again, on to boulder type things, in cold weather... but it was totally great. if you liked this one, go get the others too...
Example: [Good Cables!] I bought these for a project that I was doing and they added the needed length and clarity to my projector that I needed.
Example: [Unreliable PDA phone] I am now on my THIRD Treo 600. The first two were replaced because the phone would turn itself off and back on again, go out of service when calls were being made or received, and losing my programmed data. My third treo is only a week old and is dropping calls constantly. I have been happy with the phone when it works, but, reliability is a serious problem. Verizon Wireless has been no help either other than in replacing the phone under warranty which takes no less than 2 hours of my time and two days to ship. Battery life is less than expected and I'm usually recharging the phone by late afternoon. Another annoying feature is the low battery warning that must be cleared from the screen if you're trying to dial in codes to check voice mail or other dtmf services. It will interrupt you every 10 seconds. Also, the person on the other end can hear your low battery tones, voice mail notifications, etc. Annoying.
Example: [The Streets of Osaka?] This movie projects the come back of the "Streets of San Francisco" of the 70s but the setting is in the city of Osaka, Japan. In this movie, Michael Douglas teamed up with young stud, Andy Garcia, both cops in battling a Japanese syndicate who is involved in counterfeiting money. Packed with action and motorcycle stunts, this movie depicts a difficult alliance with both cultures in battling crime, but in the end comes a common understanding of putting the bad guys behind bars. Subtitles in english is not an option although they are shown when japanese is spoken. nice flick!
Example: [Very funny] I sent this to my son-in-law serving his 2nd tour in Iraq. His comment was that this was a very funny dvd and enjoyed it very much.
Example: [JBuds Earbuds] JBuds Hi-Fi Noise-Reducing Ear Buds (Black)These work as advertised. They are clear in tone and comfortable to wear.
Example: [poor quality, bad spacing on brackets] The sanding on this shelf was poorly done and requires more work. And the brackets are spaced at 28", rather than the 32" that is required to go stud to stud. So with only one screw holding up each side, you can only anchor it in drywall. That means that you can't put much weight on the shelf. Very disappointed...
Example: [Okay...] Well, this book was highly disapointing. I am aHUGE Phantom Phan and I absolutely love Erik, lol- but this book had a terrible portrayal of Erik.I hated how they described Erik. Erik was describedas more evil and selfish rather than loving towardsChristine. He lusted after Christine, rather then loved her. This is definitely not Gaston Leroux's version!I have many Phantom books - this one, I have to say, is myleast favorite!
Example: [In need of this item] My boyfriend is diabetic and he an out before we went on vacation. He usually gets them from the hospital.
Example: [WHAT THE?????] Who are these guys? This has got to be some kind of bad joke! What is the point of this cd? I beg of you don't buy this thing. This is no tribute! In my opinion it sounds like they are mocking Eminem. Just listening to the samples made me wanna puke. Excuse me while I go put cotton in my ears to stop the bleeding!
Example: [Not for Heavy Duty Use] We make a lot of whole grain breads, which typically have a stiffer dough than white bread. We used this machine about twice a week for several months. After noticing that the loaves weren't rising as well as at first, I stayed around in the kitchen and discovered that the motor was laboring and the paddle was barely turning. I made a few loaves of white bread; rising was better, but not as good as at first. One day the machine began making terrible noises and I ended up kneading by hand.Sunbeam replaced the machine, which was still under warranty. I've used the new one to make white bread, with small amounts of corn or oat flour added, with acceptable results. Yesterday I tried a loaf using half whole wheat flour, along with some white and some rye. When the motor began laboring, I stopped the machine and completed by hand.I'm now in the market for a machine with a stronger motor.
Example: [Bad Pair of Shoes] I saw this pair of shoes and thought that they were very cute, however, when they arrived they had smalls stains on over the front of the shoe. Very Very disappointed, I will return the shoes and never order anything from this seller again.
Example: [Great Help] This book is great because it is tabbed for easy reference. It was a great price too. It can be carried with you anywhere. And I love that it spaces to write everything from the propasol to your wedding vows. It includes tips to save money also, without sounding like you're trying to be cheap. It has all the directions for addressing envelopes and reasons behind some old traditions. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because it sounds like it's almost trying to help you plan a very upscale, classy, expensive, almost unrealistic wedding at times. But otherwise it is great. I definately recommend it.
Example: [rev raptor the lamest zoid ever] this model kit stinks it has low move ability lame weapons and no articulation
Example: [THE BEST BOOK ON EARTH!!!!] HI I am 14 years old and have just finshed reading this book. "Out of Harms way" is A MUST for any animal lover. It tells of an amazing AWSOME lady named Terri Crisp also author. This book just amazes me at how much this women did with her liufe and how full it must feel to her. to keep it short though all i am going to say is YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is worth its weight in gold. when you open this book you can't put it down and each page will keep you intersted and amaze you even more than the page before. so READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!
Example: [Card is (probably) great, seller is ......not. $7 to ship???] Still haven't received my order yet because they sent it to somewhere in Washington, which would be fine if I didn't give a shipping address in Florida. After four days, I still have no response to my email from the third party seller, which is apparently located in rural Kazakhstan judging by what they charge to send it to you. Seven bucks for what must be among the smallest, lightest items on the entire Amazon site? Come on...
Example: [Amazing book that left me deeply moved] This is one of the best books I have read in a long time. It is a simple story of mistakes and cover-ups that haunt a family for a lifetime. The quality of writing is stellar. The scenes and emotions are so vivid that I felt that I was almost there as this family's story unfolded. I felt like I was made to see the story of this family's pain through many different prisms and lenses (just like in real families) and each one of those views left an imprint inside me and moved me. It is a truly remarkable book, and I will remember it for a long time to come. I read the book over a brutal 40 hour journey (many delays and flight cancellations) but I remained largely oblivious to it all. The book had transported me to another world.... I will read everything Kim Edwards writes! Looking forward to the next book!
Example: [A slight, nearly perfect memoir...] A rare glimpse inside the mind of one of America's greatest novelists and screenwriters. It is both fun and rewarding to learn what goes on behind the scenes in the movie industry and what goes into a novel as complex as The Cider House Rules.Mr. Irving is in a position to be entirely subjective - he's earned this forum and he uses it to his advantage. This is a book of opinion and nowhere does the author hold back.If you care at all about what goes into the maknig of a top quality movie and what goes on inside the mind of one of our best, pick up My Movie Business.
Example: [very nice planer] I picked up this planer in August and have since used it several times preparing wood for many projects. As advertised, it is very heavy and takes a number of hours to set up. Once the machine is assembled and adjusted, it does a wonderful job planing woods. It must be used with a dust collection unit as you will soon be in a mountain of chips! The two speeds are nice - you can buzz through a pile of wood in short order and then finish the boards on the slower setting - although with sharp blades, it is difficult to improve on the finish at the faster setting. The maching and parts were nearly flawless - the only fault I have observed is that one of the screws that fastend the oil gear box leaks a small amount of oil.My experience is that this is a very good quality machine.Bob
Example: [Paramount apparently doesn't want my money...] My wife has had this title pre-ordered for well over a month. I guess they don't want to do business with us.I think I'll avoid all Paramount titles from now on.
Example: [Pretty Lame] Yeah, they died. They all died. The old salt had warned them the berries were poison and to never eat them. The toddler ate them first - then mom and dad decided to eat some to - so they could all go together.Now a sequel where the toddler who ate the poisonous berries DIDN'T die.Boo!
Example: [Juice Master] Very pleased with this....have started the turbo charge my life programme...thank you - far cheaper than buying locally!
Example: [If you want Bologna, look no further] The story is true, but exaggerated and important parts left out.Under the Banner of Heaven is a fictional account for faiths that would like to bash the Mormons.
Example: [Why no "Ties Your Mother Down"] It's beyond me how some knucklehead can put together a 3 disc Queen "greatest hits" and leave off "Tie Your Mother Down." If I'd been paying attention I probably would not have bought this. Now you know...
Example: [Funny and poignant] Millie Crisswell's books have always kept me entertained. The Wedding Planner is very humorous, but also very poignant. This is a book to curl up in front of the fire with--or to read on the beach--or in the bathtub!
Example: [A real page turner] I caught an interview on Larry King with a few of the principals of the expedition, and I knew I had to read this book. The horible outcome of the expedition aside, Krakauer does a spectacular job of describing the ascent to the top and, if the story had ended there, would have been a very interesting account of high altitude climbing. Though, the description of the resulting tragedy was a little less clear than I would have liked, the story was gripping and unforgetable. True, there were a lot of names thrown around, but the "Who's Who" at the beginning made this much more managable. This is great reading and nearly impossible to put down.
Example: [More than just nostalgia] Hank Halio manages to convey the old stories from Sephardic Turkey and 'dahntown' New York City with a warmth and affection that brings them to life and makes them as entertaining now as they were then. Moreover, anyone wanting to brush up on their Ladino, or in my case, learn more than I knew from home, has a great primer here, with a glossary, conversations (and translations), sayings, and so much more. It is a very, very good book, and I only wish there were a sequel.
Example: [good but not very good] some interesting library and book shelf layouts but i feel the author didn't go as far as could and should have. i subscribe to many home periodicals and have seen so much more in those than with this one book devoted entirely to physical book display. good book but at price definately top retail.
Example: [Stan Helsing] Stan Helsing is like A Bad Modern Day SNL Skit(Yes SNL Has not been good In Years). Put in Somebody Unfunny like Thompson From Unfunny SNL,And the other twits in the cast with the Exception of Leslie Nielsen and you have a Mediocre Movie at best from The Catholic Priest/Altar Boy Jokes to the bad costumes of the "Monsters". I wish they would Stop Milking Scary Movie(the First 3 or 4 were Funny).
Example: [Durable, reliable, reasonably fast, cheap -- good bargain] I've had this HDD for about 3.5 years now, and have had no problems with it at all. It's durable (I've been carrying it around it backpacks and riding bicycles with it, etc.), reliable, and reasonably fast for data transfer to/from another drive (although moving files on the drive itself is a bit slow).There are of course, larger faster smaller drives out there, but this one is a good bargain -- if this one meets your requirements, I think you'll be satisfied for the price.
Example: [Five stars for this?] I am a young adult librarian- and I am stunned this book does not have any negative reviews. This book has a laundry list of inexcusable issues: the character of the mother is as one-dimensional as they come, the dialogue is laughable, the resolution of the story is so implausible and unbelievable. The protaganist fights back against lies, stalking, and peeping toms- by lying, stalking, and turning into a peeping tom. It's all just nauseating trash.
Example: [Great expectations, poor presentation] The only good thing I can say about this product besides the aggressive advertising effort, is that it has the perfect size cup for a single serve drink.As I was happily putting my protein drink together, I turned it over to start blending. All I heard was a whirring sound.When I removed the cup - I saw that the driver bit - the part the turns the blades around was all worn out and busted.All these cups and serving pitchers, and colored lids, and cups and all the accessories - was worth nothing.I cant recommend this product - it has a very limited life span. Less than a year if you use it 3-4x a week.Won't buy it again.
Example: [Teen's Review] I didn't like this book so much because American Girl has a tactful way of wording things. You'd think this is a good thing, but it's really not, becuase most of the book suggests being a good friend, but what if your friend is the one that's complicating things? If you have a specific relationship with a friend that's not working out, this book will help you out somewhat, but won't answer your specific concerns.
Example: [Simple but effective] High praise for the Vega fence. It is simple to install (30 minutes)and works great. Needed to file a couple holes a little bigger for height adjustment. It glides smoothly, locks positively with little effort, is easy to remove and love the micro adjustment. When I up date my saw, I'm keeping the Vega fence.
Example: [Overrated to the extremus] I saw this movie in a theater in January of 1984, and if I never see it again for the rest of my life, I'll be a happy man. My loathing for this film knows no bounds. It's perhaps the most un-worthy film to ever be awarded the "Best Picture" Oscar, beating out much better candidates like "The Right Stuff" and "The Big Chill" that were nominated that year. As I was watching it, I kept saying to myself "When does this get better?" It never did, not once over its achingly long 131 minute running time. My former co-worker called this "the movie where the mother and daughter talk on the telephone all the time." Which it is. Throw in some infidelity and an incurable disease, and that summarizes this piece of nonsense on celluloid. Avoid this movie at all costs.A few months back, I actually tried to watch this on TV, to see if my opinion had changed over the years. Well, it did. I hated this movie even more. I didn't think that was possible.
Example: ["Nine" on the ten scale.] This is the new album from Nine Inch Nails. Just Kidding. "Pretty Hate Machine" was originally released in 1989, and did for industrial music what "Nevermind" did for grunge. Much of the success of this debut came because of the time of release (the beginning of the alt-revolution), as well as it's appeal to metal-heads, goths, punks, and alternative types in general. If the masses couldn't handle Skinny Puppy, they could handle NIN. Many would call this industrial-pop, but regardless of how you classify it, it's extremely good. "Head Like A Hole" is still one of their best songs, and my favorite "Down In It" and "Sin" were also popular singles. However, some of the other tracks are what really make this disc, underrated cuts like "The Only Time", "Ringfinger", and the moody "Something I Can Never Have". Overall, I do believe that 1994's "The Downward Spiral" is the one essential NIN album, but saying that "Pretty Hate Machine" is no good is simply a "Terrible Lie".
Example: [Bad music] This CD is the worst CD i've ever heard in my life. Mainly because the songs(remixes) are so dumb-sounding. I would rather listen to ten hours of somebody scratching their fingernails across a chalkboard than to hear this CD.
Example: [Would be a five with a few additions] It can take the weight and operates smoothly. After a very short period of usage I got comfortable with the controls. I would have liked two improvements 1. it does not have a level bubble - solved by buying a bubble that attached to the flash shoe 2. the base is not calibrated which helps in panaromic photos. I have used it for macro and telephoto shots as well as general landscape shots and am very satisified
Example: [An Enjoyable Version of The Classic Story] This film is pretty good. The animals looked great. This story has always been a cute but very sad one. I really prefer the animated version better. Maybe it's just because that's the version I saw as a child. I didn't think Julia Roberts was a good pick for Charlotte. Her voice is so mono-tone and the original Charlotte had a pretty voice. Overall I still highly suggest you see this version.
Example: [Biased Drivel] Hmmmm. A book on biased reporting by someone with an overwhelming and obvious bias. With "Alice in Wonderland" logic and little factual support, the reader gets the point of this dreary book very quickly. Wouldn't convince a child of the author's point, but might stoke people predisposed to the author's conspiracy views.
Example: [magnalite] Excellent cookware I'm going to purchase more later. It is easy to clean and very little sticks to the pans
Example: [Fantastic after correct setup] These earbuds are great but you have to set them up correctly. First, they have to be put into your ear canal not just hanging in your ear. Second, you must use the correct size rubber earbud cover. I initially used the smallest sized ear bud cover because it fit in easily but I was a bit frustrated with the weak bass. After switching to the medium earbud cover the bass was absolutely fantastic. I recommend these 100% and they are infinitely better than standard Apple earbuds. I suggest trying the earbuds on first with the small black earbud cover to get used to inserting them into your ear; then use the mediums for incredible sound.
Example: [Great! Love her relaxed personality!] I have an extensive library of yoga videos and this one is probably going to become one of my favorites! It's only 45 minutes long, but I feel great afterward -- love that there are modifications for every level -- I'm flexible in some ways but not in others so I can pick who I should follow based on how I'm feeling. Love that it's an athletic but not too new-agey (similar to the Sara Ivanhoe videos -- which are also my favorites). Definitely recommended to add to anyone's in home yoga practice.
Example: [Stopped working after a few hours!] It seemed really nice at first - thought it was a great buy. After several hours, it just stopped. No jam... just wouldn't respond. Returned it and got the Porter-Cable US58. It costs 3 times as much but it works great!
Example: [inside the woman and the man.] The thing that stirkes me more than anything in this book is the sad realization of the fact that very light things(like crossing a certain border) could bring down heavy consequences. Consequences that would shape ourlives and hence ourselves in a drastically different way. All over the story the inside of the man and the woman performed the same torturing dance. But only inside the heavy she became certain that he loved her. She was happy to know that he really did(happinees is light) and she was sad(heavy) to see him the victim of the proof. Milan Kundera flips the coin of heavy and light showing us different faces (of many different dark colors) for the same two sides of his coin until all the faces blend. He is a true magician.
Example: [Really?] Well, as live shows go...this would be a "2" with some "6" around the middle and heading back to "2" through the end.Jani wasn't even trying to sing through most of this, not even trying...and we all know that you don't listen to Warrant because of the irreplaceable band members right?Bummer. Crossing my fingers that the rest of my Warrant selections come in and sound great. This one, uh, not so much folks.
Example: [Underland Review] This book was well written but it was not my style of book. I really like the author. I would recommend this book to anyone.
Example: [Harry Connick, crooner for the 21st century.] This CD is a nice collection of christmas songs. He does "sleigh Ride" with a nice swing beat and it makes this CD! I think he is a very underrated musician that deserves more attention.
Example: [The PS2 is really good!] This is the most futuristic gaming system available! The games are the best! I own a N64 but the PS2 is better by a mile! I would reccomend it to anyone!
Example: [Not worth it] Just buy a clear windtunnel and the whisper fans because with the fans you can't tell that the LEDs are really working because of the fan LEDs and would save you some money
Example: [Terrific tool for the harried parents of a newborn.] This book turned out to be very handy when I had my twins! My girls were on different schedules and I was so exhausted I couldn't remember who had eaten or slept. I started keeping notes so I could see if there were any patterns, and work towards getting them on the same nap schedule. The only downside is that it is designed for one baby, so I had to find a way to notate both babies on one page. I went through two copies which now serve as a reminder that yes, it really was as nutty as I remembered! I have since given this as a gift. What's more you can often find it here on Amazon at a very good price.
Example: [Metallic Emo Kids Provide Riff Therapy] Thrice melds Brobdingnagian riffs with melodic hooks, complex song structures, and socially aware lyrics: all elements combine to form a spitfire of a record. The record commences with a trifecta, each song flowing and segueing into another. The single "All That's Left" is justified but falls short of the dazzling title track, a pitch-perfect synthesis of pop and metal. Not to mention that the lyrics are rife with optimism and a fresh outlook, ideas not usually evoked in this genre. "Paper Tigers" is all throat tearing screams punctuated by stacatto guitar, a typical hardcore jaunt and the likely supect for weakest track. It could be said that some of the songs sound like duplicates. Nevermind that. Just concentrate on your thundering heart and sweaty palms.
Example: [Neat design] THe Hakuba FP-L1 is a nifty, small, mini tripod! The all metal construction seems very sturdy and well-put-together. It also has a key-turn nut for the camera screw which is very easy to use. Also, the adjustable camera platform "clicks" into several pre-set positions which is handy as well! It folds into a very small footprint which will fit into the smallest of camera bags. Note, however, that the tripod does not have a horizontal swivel head on it like I had hoped. It just has a vertical adjustment. This tripod would be great for macro work or simple travel setups.
Example: [Thinkpad T40 good battery] I wolud like to know how much time to charge it before use it first time and the better way to take care of the battery.Thank you.Marianela
Example: [22% of The Old Testament] I've recently started a new study of the prophets in the bibleand came across some books in my library that I have treasuredfor a few years. This book has some deep commentary about thefour major prophets of the Old Testament. Jeremiah and Lamentations,Isaiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel. Also in this volume of the O.T. Surveyseries is complete with Maps, Charts and Diagrams.If you're studying the Word for insight, perhaps Eschatology oreven some Soteriology I think you'll find this book a good selectionfor review.It's a library keeper for me, which means a good reference book.hope this helps you!
Example: [Not worth to make a DVD out of it] I would not say it the way others do in reviews, an orchestra that is not from german speaking soil can shure play Bruckner as good as a Berlin Philarmonic. The problem with this orchestra from Israel is that it simply is not a top level orchestra. When I hear the many missed tones from the brass section (the wagner tubas even miss the tones in the first measures) and the bad pitch of the strings, I would say for an amateur-village-orchestra they play pretty good. The conductor swings his lower jaw around it seems he could loose it any moment. His conducting is very theatralic, I dont understand much about conducting but he does not make a good impression.
Example: [I have my summer back] I know this particular cleaner is intended for above-ground pools but at the price I was willing to risk it with our in-ground. Wanda does a great job even in our in-ground. It struggled getting out of the deep end at first but that turned out to be because our filter needed maintenance and was not providing the suction needed. I sorted that out and now it wanders through out the entire pool. I need to manually clean the sides and occasionally sweep the corners near the steps but this is a great starter cleaner it is already giving me back my summer to enjoy our pool. With two children I am over the top about a clean pool. We have many trees in our yard and this lead to cleaning the pool almost every day. Now I can just drop Wanda in the pool and let it go while I can do other things. I may upgrade to one intended for a in-ground pool but I am going to see how long this one lasts.
Example: [Best christmas cd ever] I have listened to this cd every Christmas for the last 20 years. The songs have touched my heart everytime I listen to them. The track "One Small Child", being my favorite, has nearly worn away (if that can happen to a cd). Aretha Franklin'strack of What Child Is This is most unique. I would recommend this cd to anyone who celebrates Christmas.
Example: [STEAM? Where? Cold water, occasionally tempid] I am so disappointed with this product. I am embarrassed to say how much I paid for it two years ago. I bought it based on its ratings here. Big Mistake!I recently attempted to use the hand attachments to clean my chairs. WHAT A MESS!! The hand attachment sprays all over the place. In order to get WARM water, you have to hold down the water spray button for several seconds, leaving your chair cushion saturated, and your floor wet!Hoover should be ashamed calling this a STEAM vac! Its down right misleading. What a waste of money.
Example: [Good Choice] I am relatively new to the world of home exercise, with the exception of a few TaeBo videos. I bought this DVD because my thighs have always been a major problem area, and after doing the video twice am very impressed. The exercises are explained well and very easy to do- its the repetitions that kick my butt! The models are a little lifeless, but their physique is definite motivation. Overall, this DVD was worth my money.
Example: [Bloodsucking friends] My son (15) and I have now both read this book (I have started 'you suck', and the boy is badgering me every day to get me to finish it so he can have it). It's a great anti-twilight; very funny, quite gritty and yet you still feel compassion for the characters.
Example: [Boring] I'm going to have to disagree with the majority of the reviews on this movie. I have seen plenty of Russian films, and many of them have been slow and entirely reliant upon the emotional component. Mikhalkov, for example, is a director who can do this. This movie suffers from pretentious screenwriting, and a lack of underlying meaning or moral lesson. although the acting isn't necessarily bad, you don't get attached to the characters. I got the feeling that the cinematography and the colors didn't match the movie's theme and plot. At times it got so boring that i wanted to stop watching, even though i never do that. Anyway, I do not recommend this movie. IF you want to watch some good russian movies, go with "Brother", "Burnt By The Sun", "Prisoner of THe Mountains", "War", or "Unfinished Piece for the Mechanical Piano"
Example: [Primordial] I know Tangerine Dream's music since 1976. I liked PHAEDRA, RUBYCON, RICOCHET, and the first and last composition of their live album ENCORE. I also like some of their film music, especially the soundtrack for Friedkin's SORCERER. Now I bought ZEIT and realize one thing. The earlier their music, the better. With STRATOSFEAR it became commercial and went downhill from there. ZEIT allows you to enter a different world, another dimension almost. It's perfect meditation music, not like that cheap new age crap, but rich and moody experimental music. It sometimes makes me think of the FORBIDDEN PLANET score. Can't wait to hear ALPHA CENTAURI & ATEM. Simply amazing!
Example: [Poor range for me.] Does not compare with Motorola. The range was poor. Interestingly, when I pressed the call button, that was transmitted but the recipient couldn't pick up my voice and vice versa. If they work for you, then you have a good deal. But not for me.

Example: [Fantasy and Science Fiction; What's better!?] This is one of Anthony's more serious works when compared to the Xanth puns. The book--the series in fact--has the essence of both Sci-Fi AND Fantasy blended together in a cohesive work that should delight both the AD&D players and the Trekkers
Example: [A little too convenient] This was my first Jo Beverly novel and it wasn't bad. I liked the heroine Susan, she made mistakes, but didn't consider herself a tragic heroine. Con was okay. A little dense. Where I had problems were some of the "twists" in the plot. I thought they were a little too tidy. I also thought the inclusion of the Georges and the Rogues were unnecessary at the end. Like I said, not a bad book, but not really a keeper either.
Example: [Too complex and not very fun] After 90 minutes of play and no sight of an end we gave up. Got old very fast. I am a huge Jeff Foxworthy fan but this game was way to complex for a redneck like me.. Don't waste your money on this one.
Example: [Darth Vader still #1!] No way in the world can I believe that Xixor is as smart and cunning as Darth or Jabba. There was not enough space action or blaster showdowns as it should have. Dash Rander was okay... Xixor and Guri just plain sucked. Mr. Perry took way to many chances throughout the book to build them up for nothing. I hope they both died and never come back. As far as Darth Vader's equal, PLEASE. Not on even. Vader has been around for decades, and all of a sudden I'm supposed to think Xixor is just as ruthless? Nope. I was tricked by the bestseller thing at the top of the book. No more.
Example: [Shoddy Customer Service] I can't review this product fully because it was missing parts when it arrived. So I have not been able to fully assemble the unit. I called Valley's customer service department and the person on the phone seemed sure that all the parts were there and that I just didn't know what I was talking about. After going back and forth for fifteen minutes he finally agreed that a part was missing and took down my information. It has been one month to the day that I placed the order and I still have not received the part. I've made numerous attempts to call them by phone and I get voicemail every time. I also sent an email that has not been answered either.
Example: [Breathtaking!! A powerful story of love and betrayal] I couldn't put this one down. This is the first time I've read Teresa Medeiros,and it won't be the last!!Ms Medeiros takes you deep into the story with her captivating use of words. You feel every emotion the characters go through. This story left me breathless.
Example: [Testament] I am grateful for the witness that believing Christians can obtain and strengthen from this additional Testament of Jesus Christ.Nephi, Alma, Mormon and Moroni all become new witnesses along side Peter, Paul and John. The additional account of Jesus' ministry in the Americas after His resurrection is a calming, reaffirming credential to the truth of His life and mission, both mortal and immortal.
Example: [Very disappointing Jack White group work] Huge Jack White and White Stripes fan, but this has nothing worthy of discussing. Their other album would be a better choice to start with.
Example: [Stretching for Seniors] I was disappointed in this video. Although she is in very good shape for an older person I didn't feel any energy from her. I wanted more stretches, not ballet.
Example: [Memorial Day is outstanding] I've recently purchased all of Vince Flynn's previous books in paperback so I could read everything he has written in sequence. Memorial Day is another outstandingly written book in the Mitch Rapp series.
Example: [5 Years ago...] I bought this saucepan back in 2005 from amazon.com and has been using it frequently to cook all kinds of food (mainly soup and stir-fry dishes). This pan is heavy, build to last and quite versatile. I highly recommend it :) Still one of my favorite pan after all these years...
Example: [NOT a DVD] Please be aware that this is not a DVD for use in a DVD player. It is a disc made only for the "Read with Me DVD Learning System". This was not clear in the item description and my daughter was in tears when her birthday present wouldn't work. I felt really bad for her and feel mislead.
Example: [Great for casserole storage] I have had a baking dish w/lid like this for years. I got online to see if I could find another as I use it constantly. It's great for casseroles as left overs are easily stored in same dish they were cooked in. I make meatloaf up ahead of time and put them in the freezer in this dish to pull out in a week or two. I love it!I have a suggestion for the person making a cake - use smaller cake mixes or brownies - then the icing isn't tall enough to stick :)
Example: [This is not a beginner's book, I know I am a programmer.] I wasted my money on this book. It says it is a beginner book;but it is definitly not!!! Sorry, but I would like to give ita good rating, but I just can't. In the first few pages itjumps in to complexity. I read more to see if it was gettingbetter, but it got worse. I did find a good book for begginer's.They are out there. I am surprised that the preface for this saysit is for beginner's. Number 1 best seller? Maybe I should writea book then!! This book is a reference book, not a beginner's!Trust me. I could go on and on, but if you are a beginner, all I can say is do not get it.
Example: [My Book Review] This book was required for my CULA 101 class and i found it very hard to understand some of the terms used in the text. I know the book was translated from french to english, nut i feel that the book is on a level that on professionals of the highest ranking can understand. I would hate to say it, but if you "dummy down" the book, i am sure more people would be able to understand it.
Example: [Time Machine] A pleasing variety of Swing tunes that will bring you back to the 1940s in no time at all.
Example: [A good give-away] Reminds me of the stuff we used to see on Saturday afternoon back in the 40's and 50's - I gave mine away.
Example: [This book is painfully bad] Read 3/4 of the book and stopped. I don't know why the author even attempted to write this book or how it even got published. He seems to take pride in being a maverick and general goofball. The author did nail the title though. Save your money....
Example: [peace] While I was recovering from a horrible tragedy I was given this CD from a friend. I listened to it just about every hour I was awake for months. It really brought me peace and helped me to heal. I have since used it as a gift to others that are suffering.
Example: [Junk] The lid on the cup broke within 5 uses despite the cup being only half filled with grounds. Unfortunately, I cannot return it. Furthermore, this device made a horrible cup of coffee. I tried various grind consistencies but each cup was extremely weak. You could actually watch the "coffee" coming out of the Keurig clear. Lastly, this cup leaked the water/coffee all over the counter and machine. What a joke. Keurig should be ashamed.
Example: [Amazon needs a negative star rating for this...] Say what you will about whatever you consider the worst film ever made...mutiply it by about 7 and you come pretty close to this garbage. I actually bought this (used at a video store) because it was the last film appearance by James Doohan (Star Trek's Scotty). Not only was it sad to see him so far gone but for it to be in this swill is just gut-wrenching.I won't even attempt to actually review this...just stay very far away. Even the Mystery Science Theater 3000 guys wouldn't touch this one.
Example: [Good Nail/Hair Vitamins] was having a problem with nails not growing and decided to try these......have to say they work cause now after a few short months my nails (and hair) are growing like weeds!!!!
Example: [Wow, this is great] My dog loves this water dog. At first he was a little hesitant with the clicking noise this makes when it senses the dog or something else near, but I trained him to ignore the noise. Now all I say is go get water and he goes over and gets his water. When he is in the yard by himself he will go over and get water without an issue. I really like the fact that he has fresh clean water whenever he wants it and I am not filling water bowls outside all the time. Great Product!
Example: [Nice Novel] Anyone who thinks this is anything other than a book version of National Enquirer has a short-circuit in his or her B.S. detector. I'm not saying that some strange things didn't happen, but the telling of this story is just that-- a story, meant to entertain, garner attention, and make money, and I'm sure they have succeeded at all three. Please, don't be so gullible people. It's ok to be a believer, but be smart and discerning about what you believe. If you want a for-instance, read Witness to Roswell, and compare the quality of writing, research, and documentation to this garbage. That will give you a standard by which to judge.
Example: [Pathetic] As a 20 year player of Dungeons and Dragons, I have to say that this movie is one of the worst ones I've seen in my entire life. The only entertainment value in it is laughing at just how bad the acting, dialogue, and story is. ...wait for Lord of the Rings to come out this winter.
Example: [NOT as shown] Item is NOT as shown on you on-Line advertisement! There it is shown as a complete tailgate locking system including the handle not as received consisting of only the Bezel, lock and two key! I consider this fraudulent method of advertising and do expect to be credited the full amount of purchase, shipping and the additional cost of the return shipment! returned 12 days ago still waiting refund
Example: [Terrible for skiing goggles] I have eye contacts and need an airtight fit -- these will NOT provide that because the magnet is not nearly strong enough to keep the goggles fastened under decent tension.
Example: [crap] i paid [...] bucks for tyhis gun got it and got it ready and figured out how it worksand after using it a few time si relized its flawsfirst its too damn smallits accurcy is not bad but its velocity is utter crapand doenst do squat in heavy battlesand the clip is a reduiclus system of shaking the rounds form teh clips into the spring ssystembuy this for collections and maybe for soem fun but not a good gun and it jammed after the first month and i broke it trying to fix it
Example: [Perfect for falling asleep] This CD puts me to sleep -- which is a good thing. In addition to the babbling water, there are bird and other forest sounds, but nothing is too loud or jarring. I put this in my CD player, press 'repeat' and drift away. If you share a house with snorers, it's either environmental recordings like this one or earplugs!
Example: [Very disappointed] When I bought this flight simulator I was told since I had a brand new computer that was more than powerfull enough that I would really enjoy this thing. Well I guess they lied. You probably have to spend $5,000 on a computer to run this thing and get all the effects that were put into it. I can either get great graphics with a really bad flight or a great flight with practically no graphics at all but not both. When I called Microsoft, the woman I spoke to in India could barely speak English and she didn't seem to have a clue about what my problem was.
Example: [Great shredder + flimsy bucket = total disappointment] The top portion, the shredder itself, is very well designed, but the bucket is made of a flimsy plastic that is hardly able to hold the heavy top. If I could rate the parts separately, I would give 5 stars for the top and -3 points for the bucket. If it was not for the desperate desire to cut manufacturing costs [Fellowes, why not to try using a paper bucket next?], it could have been a great shredder. Unfortunately, the product overall is not worth its shipping price, not to mention the $100+ price tag.
Example: [The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle] We thoroughly enjoyed this book. It captivates you from the very beginning. This book uses great imagery and descriptive language. We felt that the book made us feel as if we were on the ship with Charlotte. Every aspect of that book reached out to us. We feel that this would be a great book to use in the classroom. The descriptive language is wonderful and would be an excellent example to use when teaching this concept. We feel that this book would be beneficial for 5-7th Grade. Once again we really enjoyed reading this book.
Example: [Misled!] Do not buy this single if you are looking for the ballad version of Alive. Silly me, I must have missed when it was clearly stated that the version here was an uptempo one when I ordered it from Amazon, and only got suspicious when the CD arrived and I looked at the back. I'm not a great fan of J-Lo's singing but I do like the ballad version of Alive. However, there is no way I will be buying the remixes CD- what was she thinking putting a ballad on that CD! I guess I will have to enjoy it on radio.
Example: [I'm Keith Ferrazzi, the most important person in the history of the universe!!] Keith Ferrazzi thinks he's SOOOO COOOLLL!!
Example: [Nice for the price] Good product, was concerned before purchase based on other reviews. I had no problem with assembly. on the first couple of uses the mounting bracket seemed to turn on the seat post but then I realized it was the seat post itself that was turning. Tightened its bolt and everything is working fine.
Example: [Escaflowne the series] The first Escaflowne I experienced was the movie (Which was great). Then I read the comic book series (And that was awesome!!!). Then I saw the series and sank.... I was expecting the same action packed storyline with twists and cool characters as the comic books. But it seems that the anime series was the prototype for the real story. Not only does the anime series and comic book series have different views on what the characters look like, but it is missing some of the great twists and events that the comic book storyline has in it. Then I realized that the comic book was made AFTER the series instead of BEFORE.I believe that the anime series not only has some of the worst animation I have ever seen, but definitaly the worst voice acting I have ever heard (English Audio).If you really want the GOOD Escaflowne experience instead of the AVERAGE one, Watch the movie then read the comic books and totally ignore the TV series. In other words, Don't waste your time watching it.
Example: [Mediocre at best.] First the good news: the actual writing isn't bad, in terms of technical competence. The characters were mostly handled well, both in terms of dialogue and interaction; Major Kira was a bit too hostile, but that was fairly standard for this early in the series, and Odo displayed a variety of intelligence that I don't expect to see from him, but otherwise the book was well enough written to make two separate fairly uninteresting plots passably readable.But that's the bad news: the story behind the writing just wasn't interesting; it's a bad sign when the poker tournament at Quark's is more interesting than the obligatory station crisis.This book was actually written as a collaborative effort between Dean Wesley Smith and his wife, Kristine Katheryn Rush. (Sandy Schofield is the pseudonym they chose for the collaboration.) If you are familiar with (and fond of) the individual work of either of these writers, you might want to try this one. But I can't say that I was overly impressed.
Example: [Hot Tub Time Machine] I was sure this movie was going to be stupid, and I falsely believed that all the funny parts were shown in the commercials. I was so wrong. This movie is actually funnier than The Hangover! I'm going to watch it again as soon as it comes out on DVD.
Example: [Disgusting work] I hated this film. It was long, and didn't make sense. It tried to scare people, but it was more pathetic than scary. I don't think I even got a little bit scared in this film. This is the worst movie in the Jurassic Park Francise.
Example: [Charger killed my phone] I bought this charger for my LG CU500. After less than 30 minutes of charging, it killed my phone. I tried resetting my phone, took the battery out and put it back in, but nothing helps. My phone is dead. There is no response to my email from the company, overall this stands as one my worst online shopping experiences
Example: [poor choice of bilge pumps] sounds good on paper does not function automatically. If you want peace of mind use traditional float switch for auto function. Gradys was the only positive part of this purchase.
Example: [Used MS Money program] Couldn't use it : unsuitability with my computer leading to irreparable (at reasonable cost with no guarantee of result) password problem.
Example: [Same old song] I found this book lame and passe. The views expressed have seen print in seeming thousands of self-help books that came before. The story itself derivative of classic folklore including Paul Bunyan and John Henry. Just as the book suggests leadership cannot be found in a small pill or encapsulated in The Leadership Pill's pages. If you want to read about leadership invest your time reading about great leaders and judge their actions for yourself.
Example: [pains me to write this] i love to read erotica. and i've enjoyed other collections edited by marcy sheiner. but this book is such a disappointment. the stories are mostly fine stories. but i don't buy collections of erotica for "a" story. usually women's erotica offers stories that are exciting from psychological, intellectual, and sexual angles. sadly, most of the stories in this book have none of these qualities to offer.
Example: [flat] this disc is very flat.i saw it coming when Too Short got down with Jermaine Dupri.this album is nothing but a Commercial Project.it's a sad day when an Artist that has defied the Industry and done his own thing stoops to this Level.he has lost his edge&flow.
Example: [Not thrilled] This is a strange instrumental reworking of the songs from Ram. I bought it because in general I'm a Macca fan and wanted to 'complete' my collection.The reworkings are interesting only for curiosity's sake. The album I think was put together by him on a whimsical notion - hence it was never released under his name.Not worth getting unless you desire the whole set of Macca's works
Example: [Buyer beware!] This is the first time I feel strongly enough about a product to write a review. I bought it at Lowes and used it for roughly 2 years before it became completely useless. During the time it was useful, it wasn't necessarily smooth running. Sometimes it worked well, other times it seemed out of balance and lacking in power. As of last year (2007), it is useless. If (BIG IF) it starts, it idles very roughly and dies when any attempt is made to speed it up. Impossible to use. I tried higher quality fuel; I've taken the carb apart thoroughly cleaning it; I've checked the spark; etc. Nothing helps. I've also discovered through searching the Internet that others have had similar and other problems.It could be that I was spoiled by the Craftsman trimmer I had for eight years. I bought it used for $50 and it was still working well when I gave it away.Don't waste your money on this Troy-Bilt trimmer!
Example: [Great read] As a Beatles fan and a lover of things of this nature(weird true tales) I loved this book. It was so fun to realize how easily America runs with a sensational piece of crazy journalism and treats it as a topic for 11 o'clock newscasts. As a film student I see this book as wonderful material for a film, hopefully done bt me.
Example: [Disappointing] This GBA game is quite challenging, but that's not my problem with it. The problem is the graphics is low-quality and the levels very repetitive. There's very little to do other than shooting your way around, and all the soldier enemies look the same. The tiny dots that make up the enemies make it difficult to aim and shoot, so the challenge frequently turns into frustration. All this is not helped by rather poor sound effects. I do not recommend this FPS, at least not for purchase at the current high price. I hate myself for falling for the James Bond license and wasting $30.
Example: [First Rate Jam] If you like melodic and jamming jazz, you'll love this concert. The Amazon review misses the point when it says the problem is in the material and they bemoan the "jamming" --- what do they expect, structured chamber music?? Whether playing old or new material, the beauty of the jamming is in the execution, and this ensemble of musicians do a fine job of presenting a variety of material (which jams) in a very well-paced, entertaining show...that is, for anyone who loves up-tempo melodic jazz.
Example: [Quirky, mystical] This album is great for many reasons, none of them terribly formulaic. Once again Morrison has chosen to experiment with different musical forms and the result is an excellent, albiet quirky, album. The most memorable parts of the album are "So Quiet in Here" and the beautifully joyful song "In the days before Rock n' Roll." Van's voice sounds amazing throughout the album.
Example: [Models from past cycles] The season is pretty good. It is very cool because they are models from the past cycles. Watch the cycle! At first I thought I wasn't going to enjoy it but I did! I still did like the past normal cycles better thought thats why I gave it 4 stars.Thank YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Example: [A+] Good puck arrived exactly as expected. I have used these pucks and they do the job quite well. Hopefully I won't have to put them to the test again.
Example: [Kind of lame] Not very challenging and not the most clever of rules. I don't really see the interest and neither did my children. Maybe 1-3 year olds would find it fun, but not older. The rules don't match up to how the game proceeds, they don't make good sense, just kind of lame and definitely run of the mill game.
Example: [LOVE THESE SPOONS] Perfect size. I have some for some spices that I use in my cooking. I also have a 2 year old. I use these spoons for some baby food etc. Perfect size I love these I am ordering more.
Example: [The Happening] The Happening really fools you into believing this movie will be great. From the beginning to the end, this movie fails to deliver. There are some things in nature that we will never understand/comprehend. This movie has no real answers, no real twists and was overall unbelievable which is not much fun.
Example: [I was up and running with Fortran in 5 hours] I needed to learn Fortran quickly and this book helped me to do it in 5 hours flat. Just type in all the worked out examples and you are on your way. The book is also a good reference.
Example: [Excellent Product] Very easy to use and set-up. Got it working in less than 10 mins! Slightly on the expensive side, but the modem's range and reliability more than make up for the extra cost!!
Example: [good stuff] All good except that it can't consider the lights coming from side face which sometimes would cause a bad affection to your sight.
Example: [Awkward... why not keep it simple?] A small simple keyboard demands a small simple case. This is **NOT** it. The two pockets with Velcro closures should have been omitted. The whole idea of a PDA is that it can be put in a pocket where it's always handy -- and a keyboard (slim to start with) is the kind of thing that should fit into tiny crevices, much like a paperback book slides into a briefcase. The goofy pockets catch on everything, and make the case almost twice as thick. Also notice that they both face in the SAME direction. It is especially hard to put rigid items in the 'blind' pocket -- and to get them out -- unless the GoType has already been removed from the main compartment. I have thought about carefully cutting the pockets enirely off the case, but I have hesitated to do so... it seems such a drastic solution... -- This is a classic case of overdesign with inadequate forethought, and (I'm convinced) no field testing. --
Example: [Bought two of these doormats got BOTH stolen] That is how good this mat it. It's SO popular.I bought it and placed it outside my house and BOOM! It got stolen.The second time, I CEMENTED GLUE my doormat and it was really stuck on the ground... and then BOOM! Someone decided to actually take the time to spatula my doormat and steal it AGAIN.That is how popular and awesome this doormat is... -_-
Example: [I am garbage] a horribly misguided attempt at satire. I'm honestly appalled that a publisher would even read this book, let alone pick it up for publication. SAVE YOUR MONEY.
Example: [new formula] I have been a loyal Cytomax user for 12 years now. Bring back the old formula. Stevia is just too bitter. I will not buy until it uses the old formula.
Example: [Choppahead] It is a little difficult to rate because I have not received it yet. There are many products I have not received but have paid for them as Choppertown dvd also. Please contact me because I have stopped to buy due to poor delivery. I think it is outrageous that Amazon.com can not deliver products!!!!! See for your selves; purchased Aug. 2006! It is not to believe. I have sent you e-mail about this before, still no answer???regards,Andre RifaatCell: +47 906 37 232
Example: [the clock sop] This story is about a girl named Christy and boy named Danny. They wanted to go to the field to go see the horses, so they asked their mom and she said, "No."They said, "Why can't we."She said, "Because you can't go by your self, you're not big enough." So ten minutes later they snuck out.I liked this Book because horses are really pretty. I think should read this book because it is good.
Example: [POS] This POS broke on first use after being hit by a snow ball....is'nt that supposed to be the idea????!?!?!?!?? Avoid Aviva products if this is a representation of their quality.
Example: [Disappointment with revised, shortened version] Having heard the original, much longer version, I purchased this CD expecting the same. I found the shorter version hard to keep replaying because the examples just became to repetitive. Would much rather have the four discs any day.
Example: [Far from scholarly work] I am in a quandry as to how this book could be rated as highly as it is here. Anyone reviewing this book with no agenda should beable to see this work for what it is, pap.Having read and thoroughly enjoyed "The Druids" by Jean Markale, an authority on pre-christian pagan religions in general and Celtic culture & oral traditions in specific, simply thumbing through "Diverse Druids" made me realize this was the work of an armchair amateur on the subject.Rife with the author's far fetched and unsupportable speculation, and reaking from redigested information that is basic knowledge to anyone with a cursory knowledge of the Druids, this is far from a scholarly work.
Example: [Guaranteed to soothe your baby!] I received this tape as a gift when my child was born in 1992. She loved it then and loves it now. The music is calming and sends her to dream land in minutes! A great baby gift!
Example: [Lotus Guide Magazine Review] Candida Albicans: Could Yeast Be Your Problem?By Leon Chaitow, D.O., N.D.Candida albicans is a yeast that exists in all of us. Normally it poses no problem, but with everyday stress, consumption of refined carbohydrates, and especially the widespread use of antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs, and birth-control pills, it can take over one's body and cause a whole variety of problems. This book eloquently explains how this pathogen gets out of control, causing fatigue, depression, chronic pain, digestive disturbances, skin problems, ear infections, and allergies, to name a few. What I appreciate most is the author's emphasis on non-drug therapies to support reclaiming a healthy internal environment. He uses the latest research and his own clinical experience to show how to detect whether yeast is the problem behind your ills.Susie Richardson, N.A.E.T. Practitioner (Lotus Guide Magazine), Chico
Example: [big shoes to fill] Though this movie is still worth a look, by being an unofficial companion to "paris is burning," there is a lot to live up to. That documentary has an almost effortless quality, getting to the reality and personalities of each of it's characters with an unparalleled ease. This successor at times seems forced, without a real logic behind why the subjects are special or why the ball scene still holds our attention. It's as if the director's vision was too broad. Maybe there was so much to tackle that a sole topic couldn't be picked. Still, its worth a look. You get to catch up with several familiar faces and see where these great underground artists have found themselves later.
Example: [Annoying - another movie without an ending - how French!] Here we go again! This begins as a paranoid thriller and ends up nothing but a tease. A man shaves off his moustache and no one notices. He can't convince them that he ever had one. Is is a plot by everyone in his life to drive him insane? We never find out. The movie ends very abruptly without ever explaining what is happening. A complete waste of two hours. The mystery is never solved. My guess is that the writer was too incompetent to come up with an ending. Don't waste your time!
Example: [Wears out quickly] I used to wear these shoes daily. Within 1 year, the stichting along the top of the toe came unraveled on one shoe such that I could see my sock while wearing the shoe. The soft leather at the back of the shoe along the achilles tendon became ripped up on both shoes with less than one year of wear. These are extremely comfortable shoes, but don't expect them to last. $150 is way too much money to spend on a shoe that falls apart in less than a year.
Example: [Very good!!!] Five go to smugglers top was da bomb! I liked it a lot, but I hated the part for Marybelle been so shy and quiet, but it was the best for Anne! I liked Sooty the most and his maid. that none forgiving Block was who I hated the most.If you feel like reading an adventure book get this one!I do wish Enid Blyton was alive and writing
Example: [LOVE] This is what you need for frosting cupcakes. You can't find these huge tips at a regular store. They are BIG. I can fit a finger through the larger ones. They are really well made, too. I love the cleaning brush and the storage container they come in although mine, unfortunately, arrived cracked, despite the adequate packaging.
Example: [Doesn't work as advertised] I followed the directions exactly, and it didn't work as advertised. The hair did not easily slip out, it came out the same as with normal tweezers. The hair also seemed to grow back as it normally would in the normal amount of time. The tweezers are also not very good quality. I prefer to use a pair I paid $0.99 for.This product is a total waste of money in my opinion.
Example: [Horrible - and downright dangerous] We bought this (twice, actually) for our baby's room. The first Vornado room heater we bought stopped working after less than a week. It would click on and off constantly, each day making more and more noise until it finally stopped giving off heat altogether. We thought it was just a defective unit and wanted to give it another try since we liked the idea of a non-kerosene heater. Within a few days of operating the second one, we again experienced the same jarring noises. One night I went into my daughter's room and almost passed out. Without adjusting the controls, suddenly the heating element went haywire and jacked up the temperature in her room to over 90 degrees. She had already been bundled up in fleece sleeper with a blanket over her. It's a miracle she didn't die of heatstroke. The unit went back the next day and we bought a kerosene heater that has been working well and consistently for almost 3 years now.
Example: [Down alternative comforter] I bought this last year and I have been very pleased with it. it is very soft and warm I use it as a top cover on a flannel top sheet in the winter.It is a nice size covers my queen bed..It is a good alternative to down if you are allergic to feathers like I am.The only bad thing about this comforter is it needs to be dry cleaned but then all comforters needs to be dry cleaned because they do not fit in an average size washer very well. I would recommend this highly
Example: [Reprint of the OR material] This book is a simple reproduction of most of the Official Records (OR's) material regarding Parson's.It is a good source for reference material, but does not contain much original material in assessing Parsons. It is unclear if the material is complete, or just a partial collection of the records pertaining to Parsons Command.
Example: [Collapsed and almost killed me] Bench collapsed and almost killed me after a month of use. A bracket bent like a tin can and snapped off a leg. I called the company and they said they would ship a replacement part. I waited a month for the part and never came. Finally called again today, back ordered for 4 months (probably because many are breaking). You should buy the Ironmaster bench. Best bench I have ever owned, invest now and it will save you dollars and maybe your life. Apex sucks ask my ribs.
Example: [Really terrible book] About half way through I almost put this book down. I slogged through almost to the end. But when two more innocent people were murdered, for no reason (it didn't advance the plot at all)I finally gave up. That was about 20 pages before the end of the book. I really wish I had stopped half way through. Actually, I wish I had never picked up the book in the first place.What didn't like about the book? 1) the heroine was not at all likable or someone you could relate to, 2) the hero was non-existent and 3) there were three murders of innocent people that were in no way necessary for the plot.Don't waste your money or time on this book.
Example: [Spruce up your kitchen!] I love these wall-mounted openers and have bought a few for friends. The quality is good and they make a nice addition to a kitchen cabinet or other location that would be handy for this sort of thing. Recommended!
Example: [Excellent book for teaching English writing ++] This book helps high school and college students improve their writing by providing clear, straightforward, and excellent examples of grammar, punctuation and sentence structures / usage. It has a short but very useful section on the process of writing / drafting an essay (it does not go into in-depth explanations on thesis paragraphs building etc. etc.)I love it and my students love it. I use it for ESL teaching as well as for native speakers developing their writing skills. The book is also well designed, with spacing that makes the text friendly and accessible rather than daunting. The photos are very good - normal people doing normal things, easy for readers to identify with and understand.
Example: [where are the extras] loved the show - sad it was canceled. would have given it 5 stars except there are no extras on the dvd - the websites had commentary and it would have been a excellent addtion for the shows fans.
Example: [BOOO!!!!] GREAT SERIES!!!! IF you can get past the annoying dubbed elevator music! OR the loser trying to mimic Joe Satriani on a guitar! I would have never asked for this series if I had known...Shame on me for not reading the reviews first!
Example: [Amanda Only] You gotta really love AB,Which I do... But even for me, It was hard to watch,Lousy story = lousy movie.Makes me want to watch "SHE'S THE MAN" for the 37th time.
Example: [Unrealistic] This movie claims to be based on a true story, but anyone with half a brain will quickly identify the unrealistic parts. Some in the scenery, some in the costumes, but most obviously in the overall portrayal of prostitution as being an envious way of life.
Example: [The holy grail...] For me, this book was the holy grail (and is)...this is the way of looking at the fretboard that I KNEW someone had to have the keys to. I felt it was out there, and knew it would help me if I could just put it all together...And here it is.Buy this book. No matter what your level. It will help you. There is no higher recommendation I can give than this : EVERY guitarist SERIOUSLY needs this book, especially if you're a "visual" thinker who needs to understand what you're doing, rather than just reproduce (sterile sounding?) rote memory...
Example: [This is a real disappointment] Angels could be a cool album, but it's just not. I was looking forward to hearing the old Amorphis singer again, in a new forum. He's still awesome, but the rest of the band is just bad. The riffs are unimaginative and the drumming is simple and entirely too bare bones. Really, what ruined this for me, I think, besides the fact that it's boring, is that I purchased and listened to Evoken's Quietus before this album. As far as I am concerned, Evoken are the reigning gods of funeral doom. In fact, they really need to come out with another darn album. Quietus is intense, atmospheric and amazingly complex doom metal. Go buy Evoken's album instead.
Example: [great tips] The book does offer some great tips. However, you don't have to follow the book exactly. Things could back fire. Do what works for your child and don't force anything. There are many suggestions that work such as being persistent and patient. It helped me tremendously with my daughter who has autism. This book was a great inspiration for me on how to help my child find ways to get past her food fears.Now she eats a pretty well balanced diet that includes fruits and veggies and less fried foods.Thanx Brenda!
Example: [Works perfectly. Easy setup.] Saw elsewhere in these reviews that this was not a genuine Microsoft product. That is not my experience. The item I received was a legit Microsoft product. Super easy installation with Windows 7 64-bit. Done in 5 minutes.It immediately synched with an Xbox controller I had already, and another 3 minutes later I was using the controller to play Skyrim... the auto-detected and everything. Super, super easy.
Example: [Uggghhhhh...] I can't quite comprehend how anyone, I mean ANYONE... Can actually enjoy this film. I mean gosh... the action wasn't just mediocre, it was HEINOUSLY horrible. Seriously... I have seen better action sequences from an old men swatting mosquitos. And the plot... It was like a bad mix of Pet Cemetery, Highlander, and splashes John Woo and Takeshi Mike elements. I mean come on... How can anyone in their right mind take this movie seriously? The script was litterally conjured up from a bowel movement. And even though I am an avid viewer of asian films and fluent in Mandarin, Cantonese, and Japanese, I couldn't allow myself to give this movie more than an one. Movies like this actually henders the Asian film industry from reaching the upper stratosphere of film making.
Example: [It's about as memorable as yesterdays dinner ....] OK so I bought into the hype about a hot hot novel with super corruption revalations about American big biz tobbacco industry and instead I got a rerun of the A Team 'in print' no less ....To say that our hero, Shane Scully, lacks depth of character would be an understatement and I can understand why he's ready for the rubber room. I can't realy say that I even like the villan, Jody, another cadiadte for the funny farm. When we get to the tobacco conspiracy issues we are in the middle of the book and the author gets really pretty fuzzy here....I mean where's the big secret, a few years ago Colombia had a member of government that was known as congressman Marlboro ...Sorry the only thing biting and gripping in this book has to be the price I paid for it .....
Example: [Contrived Christian Romance] I am shocked by the number of positive reviews on this site. This book was boring, slow, and depressing. Whenever the author was at a loss for what to do next, she simply killed off another character. The plot line was predictable and the Christian aspects were contrived. If you want to read good historical, Christian romance, look elsewhere. You will not find it here.
Example: [Not for Those Who Tend to Get Offended] OK, I'm hooked on "Dibley" and got this particular set because the no. 2 disc in my set of the first three Dibley's broke.I think it is a series worth watching if you are youngish-at-heart, and Christ-oriented or at least don't mind the somewhat-fantasied version of the church scene; otherwise, I'm not sure the acting is worth sitting through (the writing went a bit overboard with some of the characters to the immaturish, and the amateurish). Some of the story tangents are too rude for the conservative, but if you sit back and ignore these directing mistakes and enjoy the goodness in the stories and the characters, it makes a wonderful series to watch, over and over again.
Example: [Works well but...] This product seems to work well and I like that there are no harmful chemicals. However, it has a VERY strong smell that is not that pleasant.
Example: [Needs more power] We have this in the shop where I spend my evenings. It is hooked up to the jointer, and I can tell no difference when this vac is on or off.We have a 1 1/2 hp model with other tools and it keeps all chip outs and sawdust contained, even on the planer. But the single horse model can't handle the load and we end up with shavings from the jointer all over the shop.Pull the hose out of the dust port and try to vac with it and it does absolutely nothing.I suggest you spend the extra $100 and get the extra half horse, it is definitely worth it.
Example: [useful only as a prop] This cocktail shaker was badly made, was difficult to put together and pull apart. Fine if you don't mind spilling the 60oz cocktail all over yourself! Also there was oily sludge in the seams that was really hard to remove.
Example: [Wheel of Time?... Waste of Time!] Utterly, utterly auwful. Mr. Jordan, do yourself a favour and simply disown this book altogether. Just think, you could simply stand up and say 'no, I'm sorry, it was a terrible mistake' then write another book ten, which, hopefully, would be the last in this already hoplessly elongated series.The only reason you should buy this book is as fuel for the fire. And with the amount of drivel Joran puts out, it would probably give quite an appreciable burn-time.Yes, the great, seven-spoked wheel has finally ground to a halt - and to be frank I no longer care.
Example: [Maybe I'm in the minority...] ...but I found this game to be rather . . . boring.I bought it after reading amazing reviews from Playstation Magazine, IGN, and Game Informer.I just couldn't get into it.The moves seemed repetitive to me.The graphics, even for PS2, were lacking.The gameplay was very weak.I'll play this game for a few hours, put it back on the shelf, and not touch it for 8 months.I'll give it another try, and the same thing will happen.I won't touch it for 8 months.Maybe I'm in the minority on this one.I just regret buying this game.I really wanted to like it.I just didn't.
Example: [A fanstastic journey into the life of Lewis!] This book, along with Kilby's "C.S. Lewis: Images of His World" and Hooper's "Through joy and Beyond", is essential for those Lewis fans who like to see the actual photos of where is used ot lecture, walk, talk, etc, along with the other key places in his life. With high quality paper and binding, the text is made up in large part by interviews of those who knew Lewis. This is the best book on Lewis to come out in years. Well worth the purchase! Enjoy!
Example: [It Aint Easy] I have been looking for this music on CD for many years, I am extreemly happy and satisfied.
Example: [This story is the pits] When Romana installs a TARDIS component that the Doctor has been ignoring, a distress signal is picked up and the TARDIS materialises on the planet Chloris, a planet on which metal is in short supply. As they try to find the being who set up the distress signal, they fall foul of Chloris' ruler, the Lady Adrasta, who will do anything to retain her ruthless grip on the planet...Season seventeen of Doctor Who seems to be one in which the show lost its way. As a rule, the stories were less well thought out than they should have been, and contained somewhat ludicrous elements. 'The Creature from the Pit' is one of the worst offenders - science that it would be generous to describe as half-baked, unlikely cultures, and strange creatures all conspire to drown any good points which the story has.If you aren't a Doctor Who completist, look elsewhere.
Example: [Somehow it works] Finally, a hit for Salman!Well, this takes parts of every popular film in recent years (the part stolen from Sherlock Holmes made me felt shamed) but somehow all the parts come together.The film is never going to be receiving awards, and will not be taken seriously, but that is the point.Dabaang is good fun, and good throwaway entertainment.You suspect the film-makers know its limitations, but at least they admit it. I was bored rigid by Once upon a time in Mumbai, another film that blatantly steals from other movies, but is excruciating due to the fact that the makers think they have created a work of art.In short: if it is between this and OUATIM, then I would much rather sit through this again.
Example: [Lucky if they work for you ...] I bought these hoping to have a back-up for my current favorite headphones, which are so comfortable I didn't realize how spoiled I had been. I couldn't wear these, they were too stiff (I like the flexible plastic ones) so first off they hurt my ears = no good, second due to the bad fit, I couldn't hear anything. Now I rated this with two stars because my husband actually uses them. They seem to fit him. So I'm glad they are getting use, but I am still disappointed. I'd suggest looking at other, softer plastic headphones.
Example: [Downton Abbey Season 1 and Season 2] "Downton Abbey" is an excellent series. I have enjoyed every episode of both seasons and look forward to purchasing Season 3. Well worth the money. I will watch this series again and again. There is always more to learn of the history of the early 20th Century and the effects of World War I on families in England.
Example: [no music] You have a comment space for those that have listened to the music on this cd and there is no hypertext to allow one to listen to the cd. How can one evaluate the cd if you cannot listen to it?
Example: [Given wrong book] I was given the instructors edition not the student not what i paid for whats so ever so upset i just want my money back as this point
Example: [Great things in a small package!] I paired 2 of these 6751s with a 6750 polk audio package and an onkyo 605 receiver in a 16x16 theater room. I figured since we just finished the basement I would try to think to the future so I wired for 7.1 even though a lot of things still just play in 5.1. I'm not an audiophile but the sound is crisp and clear. I have an Xbox 360, xbox, and wii hooked up through the receiver to the 58" panasonic plasma. The surround sound is fantastic on games, movies, and tv! I definitely got my money's worth with these speakers! Amazon had great prices and delivery was quick.
Example: [Find it elsewhere !!] I ordered the item and I guess it was on back order, but no one let me know. So I waited and waited finally I sent them an email and was informed of the status. Took forever to receive the item I would never buy from them again !!
Example: [THE BEST CREEPY MOVIE!] ONE HOUR PHOTO IS OF THE MOST CREEPY FILMS I HAVE EVER SEEN ROBIN WILLIAMS DOES AN EXCELLENT JOB IN THIS FLICK, BUT THERE IS ONE THING I DON'T UNDERSTAND, I DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE ENDING ALL I SEE IS PICTURE OF SY PARRISH WITH THE YORKINS I SEE WILL YORKIN HUGGING SY, DO THEY RELEASE HIM OR WAS THAT PICTURE FAKE OR REAL OR JUST SOMETHING TO CONFUSE THE AUDIENCE?
Example: [Their must be a better book on the subject.] This is a poorly structured book. You will find on many occasions the explainations are not complete and what is written is unclear. Their are often refrences to subject matter that has not yet been introduced or explained. Leaving the reader lost. If you are willing to struggle a bit and supplement this book with other material you will find it has some value but for $59... I dont think so. I will be returning my copy shortly.
Example: [Bad size] Garmin GPS coverDon't make my error and assume this cover will fit the popular Nuvi series-there are none.
Example: [good toy,good price,] [...] It took about 10 days for me and my son to get attached to the toy.Now we love it.It moves forward and backward,honks,teaches a,b,c,1,2,3 and 3 shapes in english and spanish.The remote is a good size and shape for my 18 month old son to hold it.
Example: [Double the suggested retail price???] There must be some mistake here. This purports to be the car kit, but the car kit (KPA-H2C) has a suggested list price of $29.95 and sells for that at stores all over. At $59.95, this must be something else but since there is no real description, who knows what. Does this include an fm modulator? That would be a good deal.
Example: [Immensely Disappointing] I fail to understand the purpose of this book. My intent for this purchase was to get an introduction to Descarte's philosophy. To my utter disappointment, i found this book lacking any materials to this regards. The illustrations i found rather childish and annoying. There is no mention of Descarte's philosophy or any other subject that can add value or interest to a serious reader. I am extremely disappointed with this book, every page has an unnecessary illustration, these illustrations have no relevance to the subject. If the illustrations were removed the entire book can fit in 3 pages.
Example: [Very disappointed] Unfortunately we are very disappointed with this wagon. When we first received the box we suspected that this might have been returned by a previous owner by the looks of the packaging. The wagon was missing some parts, however Radio Flyer quickly sent them after a quick phone call. Now the canopy won't snap it securely to the wagon on two of the four sides. I can't put my one year old in one of the seats because he will pull the canopy out. I have to stop the wagon every few minutes and stick the sticks of the canopy back in the holes because they keep coming out. Overall, it just seems to be made very poorly and cheaply. Which is ashame, because my little boy loves it and it certainly wasn't the cheapest choice!
Example: [Eleven on Top] Just wonderful and with the saem characters: All fun to read with great big belly laughs! What a nice change from ordinary books.
Example: [A Must Have] If you are a true Vikki Carr fan your collection is not and will not be complete without adding this CD to your collection,some of Vikki's best songs are on this CD like Unforgetable, With Pen In Hand and of course It Must Be Him, I also especially like Baby Face and For All We Know this is just a small example of what is on the CD so order your copy NOW and enjoy.
Example: [Do not count on the software, 2nd unit stopped working too] After 30 days of use the software gives an error during uploading and never finishes. Seems a number of people have experienced this problem. No solution offered. I would get the cheaper model and NOT rely on the software. I mailed it back to the company to fix it, they just mailed me a new one. Product must be defective with software. The second one stopped working after 2 months.Do not count on the software, but the pedometer works as a pedometer.
Example: [fake rapper] I for one hate this cd. Mainly because He is a rapper from san Fransico who tries to be a hardcore Rapper and Challange people like Jay-z, and Snoop only that to get his (...)kicked in a rap contest by these guys. Dont by bother with this cd if you are a true fan of rap.
Example: [One Use Requires Two Sheets Minimum] The sheets are quite flimsy and thin, so I have found that I must overlay (2) sheets at a time when cleaning a pair of eyeglasses. I lay the doubled sheets flat and then spray them with cleaning solution. I found that spraying the lenses first caused the sheets to become oversaturated and to disintegrate on contact. Even with this approach, the sheets fall apart quickly. I will probably increase to (3) sheets at a time just to get rid of them more quickly. With careful use, they do leave lenses clean and scratch-free, but I will not be buying them again for cleaning eyeglasses.
Example: [Great size to take along] As with most Baby Einstein books, "Dogs" is a great little book. It is a convenient size to stick in your purse or diaper bag and perfect size for baby to hold. Small, but the pictures still bright enough to entertain a little one.
Example: [Disappointing] I am a power Yoga buff and do tapes of Rodney Yee (my favorite) and Brian Kest (if he could only talk less sometimes...).This tape as a number of flaws: the positions are too short, many power positions seem to me to be designed to inflict pain rather than to help the training and finally, the worst, there are some sort of ads during the relaxation phase, the most horrific experience I have ever had with a tape. I jumped up from my Shavasna in horror. I find the voice of the trainer slightly annoying, but that is likely to be a personal problem of mine.In short, I tried it a few times and then tossed it as useless.
Example: [I'm ADDICTED!] I am ADDICTED to ALIAS! This show is awsome. It keeps your intrest the whole epiosode! You need to own or watch all 5 seasons!
Example: [Pontoon post guide on] The installation was seamless and the kit contained all of the parts needed to complete. After installation the pontoon was guided on even in rough water. Much safer!
Example: [For Crafters only, no haberdashers need apply.] I bought this to replace waistband buttons for work pants but found that the fasteners will not hold very much pressure. I replaced buttons on two work pants and both popped back off the very first time I moved. I still use it in craft making as it will quickly attach a button on a decoration. When the connectors that come with the machine run out I will throw the unit in the trash. Oh, who am I kidding, I'll probably throw it in the trash now.
Example: [Misleading] I know, I know, I should have read the description better but hey, it says "Porter Cable 4210 12 Inch Dovetail Jig". Not "Porter Cable 4210 12 Inch half blind Dovetail jig". Anyone would assume you could do a full through Dove tail right? Ok probably not but just be aware of that fact.If you don't mind spending extra on full and mini full through dovetail jigs then the unit is well made.
Example: [Hoover 5507-900 Elite Rewind Upright] This vacuum could be a nice product. I will never know because the BELT buned out the first day.
Example: [In the Cut] This crap absolutely reeked! The story made no sense and Meg forgod's sake keep your clothes on, you are years past nude scenes.
Example: [say huh???] Just for starters, I am an avid MMW fan, and I need everyone thinking about getting an MMW album to think about this......DONT start with this one.....I have a real hard time understanding the other reviewers because to me, this is the least comprehensive album of their genius ever put out by them(I have every MMW release). Im not saying its bad, but if you want the best start with Uninvisible, Combustication, or End of the world party (if you dig grand piano, go with Tonic)....the other reviews are totally mad. Claiming that this is the most inspired and round about album they ever made is like saying the Beatles made better albums before Revolver.....take it from someone who has seen MMW five times in three years and skip this one for next to last (last being Shackman) However, I am not so corny to think Im always right, and in dealing with jazz albums, it is totally subjective as to what is the best....
Example: [Great frames for kids (and grown-ups, too!)] We have these frames in our home to display children's artwork. It's very empowering for the kids to be able to select their own "cover" art and gives them a great sense of pride. Lots of spinning & happy dances! These are much better quality than the knock-off brands. I have also used these frames to display full size magazines. Works great!
Example: [Amanda Caldwell-enrichment] Mr. Yochum's Senior English ClassI think that this movie version of Macbeth just did not live up to my expectations. I thought that Polanski's version was quite boring to say the least. Not that it depicted the play badly but the characters were poorly picked and didn't act very well. I did like the bloody fight scene between Macbeth and Macduff in the end. However, it sort of made me laugh more than anything. Although, the acting wasn't quite up to par, the motif of hands was still used just like in the play. I think Polanski followed Shakespeare's metaphorical use of hand imagery well here by showing the scene with Lady Macbeth sleep walking. Maybe I am to young to judge such a old classic but overall i thought it was pretty cheesy.
Example: [Hp Desk jet Ink cartridge] I bought a desk jet ink 3520 ink cartridge 27 black from E-z ink inc but it dose not work . when I received it and i tried to print out but it does not work at all.
Example: [great system] I got this game as a birthday present the pack had a lot. it came with a cloth,case,head phones,movie remote,demo disc,spider man 2 umd movie,and the charging set. the game played the movie great with subtitles,diffrent languge.and scene skip.later on i bought metal gear acid. it had great 3d grafics and sound. I also bought resident evil 2. it had traliers.subtitles. and looked just has good has it does on the movies.there is not many good games out now but starting september to december you will not be able to buy them all.a list would be metal gear acid,resident evil 2,reident evil,kill bill,kill bill 2,boogeyman,grand theft auto in 3d,midway arcade treasures with mortal kombat 1,2,and 3,mortal kombat deception with the full game arcade,puzzle,chess kombat with konquest mode,namco muesem,frogger. warnig case may scratch game screen.
Example: [Couldn't get it working] I spent about an hour experimenting with the enclosure, different computers and operating systems, various hard drives, etc. with no luck. The green light would come on, and occasionally the computer would recognize that a USB device was attached, but I would never get a drive letter.The documentation is mercifully short but unhelpful.
Example: [Awesome mouse] A great mouse, even for a Mac user. It doesn't support Bluetooth which is a con, but the mouse response seems to be better than any Bluetooth mouse I've used--perhaps RF is just better for desktop wireless mice.
Example: [THE GAME IS HARD BUT ITS FUN !!!!!!!!!] THE GAME IS IS NOT SO FUN IF YOU PLAY IT ALON BUT IF YOU PLAY IT WITH A FREND OR SOMOWN ELS YOU WILL HAVE A BLAST AND THE BEST THING IN HALO 2 IS MOLTI PLAYIR VS IN XBOX LIVE !!!
Example: [Large Speckled Window Perch] I recently adopted a kitten from Siamese Rescue. I was told beforehand that he had vision issues but loved his window seat at his foster's home. I chose this one because I wanted it heavy duty in case the other cat we have (who is the size of a water buffalo) wanted to sit there, too. I read the reviews that it was difficult to use with window sills that were angled, but bought it anyway.We took it out of the box, my husband said this will never work with our 60 year old sills. We put it on the window, and it fits great! No tweaking at all. It's very level, sturdy and does not wobble at all. Unfortunately, the kitten has more issues than we were told about, and is seems to be unable to learn how to jump from one chair to another, to the desk to the shelf. Once he sees Annie-the-water-buffalo jump up there, however, he'll figure it out!
Example: [This is the WORST!] I didn't believe that it could get any worse than "Bitter", then came this "Comfort Woman" thing. Where's the funk? Where's the fire? What happened to actual songcraft (somebody done got lazy on us)? This is music to watch paint dry by! I want my "Plantation Lullabies" and "Peace Beyond Passion" back, NOW!
Example: [Very Nice! Great Price!] It was a much nicer watch than I expected for the price. Service from the seller was exceptional. Everything went without a hitch.
Example: [solid, reserved, not balanced.] This album has some great tracks; Jealousy, Wonder, and my personal favorite, Where I Go, but lacks range. Merchant keeps a dark mood almost untouched throughout her treatments of these songs. The final track is perhaps the weakest, displaying little of her originality and lyricism. This album is well worth the money though, with quietly reinforcing percussion and good guitar work, but isn't a good sampling of her best work.
Example: [ATROCIOUS!!] Don't even THINK about wasting your money on this piece of crap! It will leave you with regret and broken ear drums. The songs on this album are laughable and cheesy, with horrendous vocals and a couple of butchered cover songs tacked on to the ridiculous re-release. Jessica is simply milking her last few minutes of fame and fooling innocent buyers in the process. Don't support this overexposed, overrated, talentless, greedy cash cow!!
Example: [Breaking the Power of Wall St] This traces the story of the development of the Global Financial Crisis. It finishes with a warning that the Obama legislation to prevent Wall St ever again bringing the world to the brink again, is in fact full of loopholes, mainly the fruit of wall street heavy campaigning and distributing largesse in W.ashington.Since this documentary, Obama has appointed quite tough police to enforce the legislation. Expect to see a lot of supplementary legislation to make the banks behave responsibly.
Example: [Much better the Bushnell brand] Much clearer than a Bushnell binocular that I bought and returned. I just wish it could be a little lighter.
Example: [Sad] This book is not only something you could just cry over, it has no happiness inside. I would recomened it to those people who would like to read more about the darker part of life.
Example: [THE ROSA PARKS STORY] This story is about a black women in the days of segrigashon who was sent to jell for not following the rules. It all started when rosa parks refused toget up for a white man and the polic decided to take this inisent lady away. But not any black person blame her for what she did but they did say it was her falt she was in jailin the first place. But you can't realy blame her she was tired of giving in to the whites because they were so cruel to blacks and she was not going to take it any more so she broke the unfear rules and she dicided to make her own. Later on rosa parks started a boycotand changed the lives of millions of black people and thats A great african americn moment.
Example: [Very disappointed :-(] Before I bought mine I read the reviews and reading the neg ones I thought to myself... They probably just didn't use it right... Well.... It really doesn't work, I didn't e even see any gunk in the cleanser and my black heads and white ones r still in my pores... Lucky it's not that expensive but still feel like wasted money
Example: ["The Office" gets endorphins going] My real offices-mates clued me in to this funny program. In fact, when I kept forgetting to tune in on the nights it aired, my boss finally insisted that I go home and watch it - that I would be "quizzed" the next day. It took a few shows to get to know the characters, and now I'm hooked. I have Seasons 1, 2, 3 and have had "Office marathons," watching successive episodes for several hours at a time.The funny thing is that at one time, I did work in an office which definitely qualified for zaniness of personnel. I went home each night, incredulous that work was ever accomplished. Watching the program is funny, sweet relief from real life, getting those endorphins going; and the DVDs are worth having, to view as the mood strikes. Highly recommend.
Example: [One of the worst racing games I have ever played] To sum it up in a word, this game .... The controls are poor, all the cars steer exactly the same, the characters are plain and unoriginal and the circuit champions always have some cheap trick up their sleeve by grabbing the SAME COLOR BLOCK EVERY TIME. The Build-A-Car mode is pitiful, because all the pieces are square allowing no aerodynamicness until you snag Captain Redbeard's set. And what do you get when you beat the game? Nothing. This game is horrible. Leave it to people who like throwing money away.
Example: [bad product] Received the product, but it was all broken when it arrived....the glue on the side didn't stick and the plastic/glass covering was broken...bad quality in production
Example: [One of my all time favorites] This is the kind of book that I want to buy 20 copies of and give to all my friends. Maybe some day I will. I read it over and over again. It's a great book. I love all of Sister's books.
Example: [Used Textbook] Was happily surprised to get this "used" book quickly and in perfect shape -- no bent pages, no writing, not even worn-looking.
Example: [Unusually light hearted and user friendly...] If comedy is, as they say, tragedy in long-shot, then Greg Watkins' take on Caveh Zahedi's semi-fictional love life is exemplary comedy indeed. The scenes with the adorable landlady from hell are worth the price alone. The DVD includes a not-bad commentary track by director and star and an amusing "Day in the Life" of Watkins by Zahedi.
Example: [Easy and fast waffle] It is easy to use, just pour in the waffle batter, about 5 min, you will have a nice hot waffle. The maker is non-stick, and easy to clean. Comes out perfect all the time.
Example: [Excellent water repellent] My daughter's waterproof coat had been laundered several times and was no longer waterproof. I bought Nikwax TX to treat her coat and renew its water-proof functionality. After her coat was treated she wore it on a trip to the mountains with friends to spend an afternoon sledding, throwing snowballs, and building a snowman. It worked great! She was recently caught in a rainstorm while riding her bike, and it kept her nice and dry on her 2-mile ride home. Highly recommend this product.
Example: [The title does not fit the book] I rate this book 1 star because its title "Programming Dynamic Character Animation" does not explain what the book is actually about. The book covers an engine that you could potentially write a character animation system on and static character animation(keyframes). There is no talk of even inverse kinematics. The only reason I could imagine why they would use a title like that is get novice programmers who are interested in dynamic character animation to buy it. I feel sorry for anyone who buys this book. It should be taken of the shelf as mis-information.
Example: [WON'T EVER SHIP!] This order has been the HUGEST pain in the ass. This product and it's inability to ship is uncharacteristic for AMAZON.I placed the order back in early July and I am still waiting for it. The pain in the ass part of it is that twice a week I get an email asking me if I still want it and to "approve" the delay.It is so annoying.I loved this movie. I loved the music and the story behind the music in a part of town I never knew growing up in Houston.I can't wait to hear the songs but I am about to give up.Order this if you have a Metric Crap Ton of patience and you are not in a hurry.
Example: [I gave this away] Not what I expected. I thought a square tree skirt would be different, it was. It has no ties in the back so it never stayed together. It was also the material of a throw blanket and it looked just like I cut up a blanket and put it around my tree. After a week of frustration I gave it away.
Example: [Highly recommended for neophyte UNIX programmers.] Steve Moritsugu and DTR Business Systems' Practical UNIX is recommended for UNIX programmers who seek a reference book of solutions for common UNIX problems. From modifying and compressing files to determining how to extract fields and using networking capabilities, this expands upon the UNIX platform of knowledge.
Example: [Farmall cub research] I bought this book because my late grandfather owned a farmall cub that has several implements, although it belongs to my uncle now I wanted to research it for its originality and the year it was made, a very informitive book.I found the book to be very accurate in where to find the information I needed on the tractor itself as well as learning about the other tractors Farmall made.
Example: [Only the best living poet.] Forget Seamus Heaney, forget Galway Kinnell. Paul Muldoon is the thing. This is an excellent collection of his work. Click around here, find and read a couple of his poems, and you'll know.
Example: [Nothing but trouble] I realize that not every printer will be as bad as mine, but I have had a plethora of problems. The on/off light burned out within 2 weeks. Practically every time I print something, I have to clean or realign the nozzles. For a while, the printer wouldn't work unless it was turned on before the computer. And if this is being miserly with ink, I'd hate to see what regular ink use is! You get what you pay for, I suppose.
Example: [Made me want to cry!] When I first read this book, it seemed interested because of the way the cover of the book is and how the words she said actually came to heart, at least, my heart because it made me think back how I grieved when my grandfather died in 1998. The book made me want to cry! But really, Maria Shriver is a good writer and I can't wait to get my hands on her next book!
Example: [Poorly manufactured and will stop working on you - I Promise.] Freeze ups in the middle of songs, constant resets with a paper clip, and finally the nasty "upgrader" message.. i.e means your up the creek without a paddle. Sending mine back for a replacement and hoping the problems are fixed.Not Happy.
Example: [Great book] This is a great book except I prefer the edition in the original language. The translations partly minimumize the puns.
Example: [Waste of money] For Christmas, I ordered 2 volleyball posters for my daughter. I was very unhappy with both posters. There was no mention in the description that they would arrive folded in quarters instead of rolled up. There were deep white creases across both posters due to being folded. This is extremely noticeable on the poster with the black background. The website also did not list dimensions-irregular size-17"x22"- will not fit regular size poster frames. These posters remind me of what used to come free inside a cheap kids magazine. Complete waste of money!
Example: [Defective Wranglers] The middle of the right front pocket was riveted to the right pant leg. The jeans were unwearable. These pants were definitely defective.
Example: [Not so great] When i received my video, i used it everyday for about 3 weeks, at the same time i went on a low fat diet as suggested and still the video did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. I think i could have done a better work out. I am a professional dancer and do not think that this video is effective. Next time, i'll stick to a personal trainer. If you buy this video, you are wasting your money!
Example: [Touching Account; No New Revelations] This touching account forces the reader to evaluate his own life in the light of the wisdom Morrie offered in his final days. But, I couldn't help but think throughout ... I've heard this before. An effective new channel for an old message about the truly important things in life.
Example: [The movies are much, much better] This book is the reason I've sworn off ever reading "classics" -- they're wordy and boring. This book feels like Carroll's attempt to "astonish" 19th-century adolescent girls. Wow! yet another impossible situation! Stick with Disney's & Depp's movie versions -- they're much more fleshed out.
Example: [110% satisfaction guaranteed] The movie itself is a perfect 100%. Good acting, good writing, good story. However, since I'm supposed to be reviewing the product, that is, the DVD and not just the movie, I think I'll give it a bonus 10% because it's got a lot a really neat DVD extras, like bloopers, deleted scenes, and behind the scenes production numbers.
Example: [Great toy] I bought this for my nephew. He loved it as soon as we pulled it out of the box. The only thing that would make this better would be to add a little more power to the drill. It wouldn't take the screws past about the halfway point. But it is still an awesome toy!
Example: [unsatisfying western romance] I've enjoyed a few of Ms. Joyce's novels, even the very un-PC "The Conqueror" but this one left me with a sour taste. With too much violence for a romance novel, at least for my tastes, and an unappealing heroine, by the novel's end I was left with a feeling of exhaustion rather than exhilaration.
Example: [A Multitude Of Mercies] This book is excellent. Anyone with schizophrenia in their family needs to read it. Written from the families viewpoint, makes it even more valuable. I highly recommend it.
Example: [superb] This is the greatest popular music album of the 20th century. Period. Apart from it, only Abbey Road, by The Beatles, shares the top position of creative innovation in the history of contemporary music.
Example: [Cool] It was cool. Same concept and stuff from the earlier Civilization games. Just looks a lot better. No problems here.
Example: [A Classic] HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES is a fantastic and classic horror film. The reason I saw this movie is because I enjoyed Rob Zombie's music {White Zombie and solo} and I thought it was cool that he was taking a intrest in love of horror films and he was actually going to make one and knowing from the music videos and cd's I knew it was going to be good and I was right. I'm a not fan of more recent horror movies {except for the remake of the "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and "Dawn Of The Dead"} cause I think the horror film genre has went down hill after the 80's. I really enjoyed this movie cause its like a classic horror movie and its set in a cool time peroid and its not one of those horror movies that make things so techinal. This is one of the most original horror movies that I have seen in a long time. I just hope the sequel is just as good.DVD: The DVD was alright but I would like to see the unrated version.
Example: [Excellent case for Pentax K200D] I bought this for a Pentax K200D and it fits quite well; there is a little extra space around the camera but not enough that the camera moves around inside. With the camera inside, the case balances well on the hard "cap". There is a velcro-secured pocket under the zipper lid, and a small zipper pocket on the outside front. Both are large enough for a filter or two, or memory cards and an extra battery.The included shoulder strap is of the el-cheapo variety, but functional nonetheless. The belt attachment is sewn-in and requires you to thread a belt through the case. I prefer the twin loop snap/velcro attachment of a similar LowePro case I saw in a local camera shop (which attached well to two rows of MOLLE webbing), but the LowePro seemed less sturdy and more expensive.
Example: [Coulda Been Great!] What could have been an exciting read is weighed down by superfluous description... after description... after description. I found myself wanting to edit the book - I couldn't focus on the storyline anyway! I'm glad I got this from the library and didn't waste money on it!
Example: [Incredible and emotional] I first saw Pavlo in a little restaurant in Birmingham Al. They were just passing through and stopped in to play. It was right after the release of His Fantasia cd. We were blown away. Since, I have introduced many people to them. I just got the Mediterranean Nights DVD. It is absolutely incredible. The talent, skill, and raw emotional. Unbelievable. It is truly a must see. Brian Richmond Virginia
Example: [Does its job] This water additive does it job of keeping dirt and hard water lime etc afloat in the water and making it easier to maintain the Venta humidifier/air washer. It was promptly delivered at a price lower than I can buy it locally.
Example: [Completely Unimpressive] I've never seen the show live or heard any other recordings so I can't say if it's Cabaret it'sself or just this movie that's bad. I found this film to be so boring and the music so annoying that I turned it off after 40 minutes. If you're a fan of Cabaret then you might like this (I really wouldn't know) but all in all this is a really tiresome film with only a few worthwhile moments
Example: [Excellent but the description is wrong] Okay I saw the movie just a few hours ago and none of what is described above is what I watched. Okay, yes a couple did clam to be forced to do acts infront of a camera but the rest of it is bogus, least the one I saw (it was a close to final film).Now to tell you a little about the movie, I'm not one for giving anything away so I'll leave it more as a "who done it" kind of movie.Silent Voyeur was leaps and bounds beyond what I expected from Georg Koszulinski. His first film Blood fo the Beast, was rough but anyone could see he had a story to tell and given the funds he could tell it, well Silent voyeur is it.The movie was at a perfect pace and always had you feeling wrapped up in the events. A great pychological thriller that should not be over looked.
Example: [Works but not touchable] It did work, but it made my hair feel disgusting. If you just need it to look fuller, but don't ever want to touch it, it's great. I think the TIGI little pump bottle (purple round dispenser) works even better, but still leaves a residue that makes my scalp feel like it is suffocating.
Example: [Generational touchstone] Okay, I'm 19 and most every other 19 y/o I know has seen this film, I mean it's like everyone around my age range has viewed this film and loved it. It's a great film and I just wish I was going on the adventure with them. I didn't want it to end. Hey Steven, do us a favor and put this on DVD! We need this! I've been watching this film on television for years and the nostalgia just kills me! I love it!
Example: [Alec Guinness is George Smiley] The movie, while good, does not do justice to the story. You need to see the Alec Guinness mini-series. I love Gary Oldman and he does a good job but the story is too neat, too easy, and worked too hard to fit into the 2 hour movie format. After watching the Gary Oldman version it just slapped me in the face how really good the diabolical chess match with Karla was in the Alec Guinness version, especially considering it was 1979 vintage. Even with that comparison there were still several very good scenes in the movie.
Example: [Large amount of space, but might not always work] This Gamecube Memory Card appears to have everything: Decent price, huge storage space, Nintendo branded. However, many people are having issues with the Nintendo Wii correctly reading it. That's not to say it doesn't work for everyone, I'm sure there are cases out there where it does. The internet seems filled with cases like mine, however. When you go to save a game on it, Gamecube games on the Wii do not recognize the card.
Example: [One word for this doll.......that is.....hmmm...] WOW!!!!!She is pure pretty....I love pinkhair..and her dress!!!So what if her legs are painted??It's cool!!Only barbies got the idea!!!Her hair is soooooo pretty!!!I reallllyyyyyyy like the curls!I wished I had hair like hers......ah well....I can dye my hair pink at least.....ok back to the doll....i was a little dissapointed how delicate the wings are....because after taking her out, Put her in the suit case and her wing bent....well I fixed it anyways.It's a good toy....really.Hope this Helps!!Barbie Fan
Example: [I love my best friend] a very heartfelt and warming movie. It shows that a dog is a man best friend that gives you that bond that you cannot live without. The characters are so great in the movie. I truly enjoyed this movie.
Example: [Hope all his future prdications never become true] Hope all of his predictions on our coming future never become true. May God Bless this World and its Living Beings.
Example: [Bitter taste] The seeds sprout well, it is true, but there is a bitter taste to this mixture. I use them on sandwiches and I thought there was something wrong with the non-fat mayo. Plain alfalfa sprouts taste much better.
Example: [Troy-Bilt Rear Tiller] The tiller works very well for a small to medium sized garden. It works vegetable refuse into the soil very well, finely tilling the soil. Make sure you fasten the clips on the tires securely or you will lose the clip and the tire will come off. Overall, very satisfied with the tiller.
Example: [Save your Time] It's a great book if you want to read about Mr. Greenberg's life. However, with respect to travel info it falls far from offering any useable advice.
Example: [it deservers no stars.] this the worst emo i have ever heard. The singer whines and writes the worst lyrics i have ever heard and the screamer is a little emo p*ssy. they play 2 power chords the whole song. if like this your a trendy rich brat. can't even belive victory records signed them for a good victory band listen to Martyr AD.
Example: [Bad Kindle Version] This Kindle version is bad. The words are blurry and difficult to read. Buy the more expensive version of this book.
Example: [you get what you pay for] I cheaped out and ordered this based on price. Good for general work and they are a bargin. I am saving up for a better set
Example: [Definately one of the best books I have ever read!] When I first picked up this book I thought, " well, this looks like a good historical fiction book." I was wrong. this book was not good....It was great! I actually read it in a day because it kept me on the edge of my seat. Other than keeping you tuned in, this book had a great moral to it, but I won't tell you because you need to read it yourself!
Example: [Not big enough] The Wii Pro Gamer's Case is a very good case. It does an excellent job of protecting your console. The drawback that I found is that it will only hold two of the remotes and numchucks. I need something that I can carry all four sets of my remotes and numchucks.
Example: [Much of his short fiction is disappointingly pedestrian.] There are some gems here, notably "Fondly Farenheit" and the previously unpublished "The Devil Without Glasses", but most of the short stories are decidedly second-rate. "Galatea Galante" is a clumsy Heinlein pastiche. "They Don't Make Life Like They Used To" is the sort of leaden "whimsy" which has plagued Fantasy & Science Fiction for the last half century. And several of the stories from the early 50's are thinly veiled diatribes against the paucity of original thought in "classic" science fiction. (Bester makes the wholly convincing argument that most of genre is little more than adolescent power fantasies, but fails to provide stories that provide a meaningful counterpoint.)Stick to the novels - THE STARS MY DESTINATION and THE DEMOLISHED MAN, Bester's best work.
Example: [Brantlinger Brings a different view] I really like the book. Her research is done with a select population of women, most of whom went to private schools as children. Thus there is an inherent bias but I think it brings a tangible light to the real divide that continues to grow between classes in America. This was a required reading for a Masters in Education class.
Example: [Boo!!!!!] Horrible Band!-Uncreative-3rd rate rock with mindless lyricsNo wonder their album is flopping on the charts and in sells...
Example: [Disappointing] Dead Tech -A Guide to the Archaeology of Tomorrow dates from 1981, with the English version in 1982 and a 2000 reprinting. Its coverage of dead factories, rail-yards, harbors, and aircraft boneyards is a disappointment. Manfred Hamm's inconsistent mixture of black & white and color photographs give the book a disjointed feeling. The quality of the photographs themselves is inconsistent. A few rise to the level art exhibited by Stanley Greenberg (Invisible New York) and Christopher Payne (New York's Forgotten Substations), while most are no better than I (a decidedly amateur photographer) might have done in a hurry with my trusty Pentax K1000 and a roll of T-Max 100 or Ektachrome 64. The accompanying text by Rolf Steinberg is noisome -- perhaps a victim of a less-than-artful translation into English. I haven't yet decided whether I will hold on to this book.
Example: [Great Book-Worst Seller] This book is great for the information, but I will never purchase from this seller again. Purchased on 4/17, email received shipped 4/18, received another email on 5/2 stating I would receive in a few days. By 5/8 still not received. I sent three different emails and could not get answers, when and where shipped from. I finally received the book 3 1/2 wks after purchase, and the book shipped from South Bend, IN to OK. It doesn't take 3 1/2 wks. even by pony express!
Example: [More than just a sci-fi flick] It would be misleading to say that the movie is just a brilliant sci-fi masterpiece. The essense of the Matrix is profoundly philosophical and spiritual. It actually makes you think about things that other movies try to make you forget about: the reality of this world and how you can personally change it.
Example: [A Cool and Excellent Book] Heidi is loveable, energetic, fun, thoughtful, and interesting. If you're into deep stories about a person's life, you should read this book. You should read it because you will probably find some things that you're dealing with right now too.
Example: [A perfect hit for kids] This movie, although a bit tough to understand for really little kids, remains firmly in my mind even though it has been about nine years since I have seen it. It teaches kids about the wrongs of slavery, and the idea that even a kid can make a difference. I can't begin to express my sorrow since they've discontinued it, I'm considering writing to the prouducer-type-people. Because if there's anything this movie has taught me, it's that no matter your age, you can still change things.
Example: [Barefoot Bride] i am enjoyed reading this book and will get more from joan johnson as the financies allow me to buy more
Example: [Awful] First off it is edited for G-rated material only - no nudity isshown - no swearing is heard everything is bleeped out and there arebig black bars covering anything exposed. So the title You never saw fits - you never see anything.
Example: [Looks great smells great!] I am a fan of turtles so i love this air freshener. It looks great in my green car. The women love it!
Example: [Easy, breezy, done.] Very satisfied with this product. Availability, price, and shipping were made very easy so I could get the item I wanted and have the perfect gift. Would definately recommend to friends and family.
Example: [black?] I bought this cd based on what I had heard in the previews on amazon, and I must say they are way too good for the album. Each song except for rust are hard to listen to for more than 30 seconds, because they are just power chords and screming, there is very little thought behind it, and it sounds like death metal, which was not what I was hoping for. Its not bad but for the black metal that we have heard from Darkthrone its a giant let down. Buy it only if u can listen to each song preview over and over again for 5+ minutes.
Example: [Closed Door] I did not see the value of this bland memoir. W.S. Merwin is a capable writer but the story he tells here will have little interest to any but close family friends and those particularily keen on this minor author's early career. "Without direction or prospect.." Words taken from the book that seem apt.(I do rank the book's jacket design by David Bullen as first rate.)
Example: [Rip-off!!!] Buying this cable is just like throwing money in the trash - cheap HDMI cables will do just as well as Monster. Monster needs to make products that actually have some justice to the price they charge. There is a small difference in analog cables and speaker wire performance, BUT THIS IS DIGITAL - THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE IN TRANSMISSION QUALITY with short distance connections! Cat 5 cabling with a HDMI plug at the end will do just as well!!! I have purchased Monster cables in the past, BUT NEVER AGAIN - this is treating consumers like they are complete idiots!!!
Example: [Kukuwa Dance Workout] I'm not exactly a beginner and the 30 minute segment got me sweating. It has fun combination of simple dance movements. For those who don't dance -me included- the steps are easy to learn after a few times. Remember this is not a dance video. It's a dance workout video. Kukuwa also is very energetic and her personality makes this an enjoyable workout.
Example: [Favorite soup bowl!] This soup is quite delicious. The broth is incredibly tasty and the fried tofu topping were really delicious and added nice texture. This is surprisingly filling given that the who bowl is well under 300 calories. I've tried most of Annie Chun's other soup and noodle bowls, and this is one of my favorite. Will definitely buy again!!
Example: [Excellent live album] The style of this live CD bears little resemblance to Fillmore East but it is nonetheless a very fine CD. Surprisingly, it also bears little resemblance to his then currect "Laid BacK" album either. This is Allman backed with a large ensemble doing a much more uptempo set and without much soloing. A number of the songs included here can only be found on this CD so it is a must for serious Gregg Allman fans.
Example: [Short-lived Relief] I had a flea infestation this year and thought I would try this fogger. I followed the instructions to the letter and even made sure I had more than enough foggers to cover the square footage in my townhouse. However, the results were less than satisfactory. Apparently, it killed the fleas but not the eggs. Within a week, I had more fleas (a lot more).Considering the amount of prep that needs to be done before fogging and the cleanup afterward, I have concluded that it isn't worth the effort.
Example: [love the Robb!] I love the characters the twists & turned all the cases take, the way Eve & Rourk love is so suited to each other. They work so well together. The other characters all have lives of their own but they are so much more when they are together. These books are aces in my book. Please keep them coming
Example: [If Only O.J. Wasn't in it] I love this movie. I remember laughing nearly till i choked all the way through it the first time that i saw it in the theater. I'd buy it right now if only O.J. wasn't in it. I just can't bare to watch the scenes with him in them, he has spoiled one of my favorite movies for me.
Example: [There are better cards on the market] These cards are alright, but the cards by White Rabbit Press are a true 5 star product. The Tuttle cards are small, thin, have only 4 kanji compounds, many of which are not commonly used. They have some typos, and the overall design is kind of ugly--the indentation is not consistent and the stroke order diagrams are handwritten! The White Rabbit Japanese Kanji Flashcards by comparison are beautifully designed poker-size cards with 6 compounds, look-alike characters and *imporant* hiragana and katakana (instead of romaji), and they come in a very nice box. It's hard to get the tuttle cards back into their box.
Example: [Excellently written--could not put down] I disagree with the reviewers who are rather harsh in their opinions about this novel. It has all of the key ingredients to make it an excellent example of the best of its genre. As usual, Cornwell's writing is superb--the suspense is gripping, the action flows throughout the book, her descriptions are vivid, and her characters are real and complex. Unlike some of the reviewers, I find her well-fleshed out characters to be one of the strongest aspects of her writing. I enjoy seeing the continuing story of Kay Scarpetta's world come to life, and I enjoy seeing her interact with the characters that we have come to know through Cornwell's previous Scarpetta novels. I say Bravo to Cornwell, and I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys an excellently-written murder/crime mystery!
Example: [Nat Geo 1152 Medium Camera Pouch] National Geographic products are made with the highest quality material. This is my 3rd bag or pouch & I'm already looking for another. Can't get enough. The pouch is perfect for a light trip to the Zoo or Park & you just need to pack a point and shoot small camera with a memory card and an extra battery. Adjustable over the head or shoulder. You can even tighten it around your waist and wear it on your hip. It has a front pocket for a wallet & velcro's closed. Well worth the money in my humble opinion. Very durable.
Example: [Works Great] This is A Great scale. It is heavy duty .Simply press one button and climb on.It is easy to see weight.The coiled cord allows you to set display at your prefered height.We are very happy with the 349.
Example: [Looks good, durable] Protects the iPod Shuffle, and more importantly, helps to distinguish which iPod belongs to which kid.
Example: [Diary of a Baby, Daniel Stern] It is a remarquable book und shows you an impressiv and new sight on the developement of the newborn child and the babies learning to use his senses during the first year of life.
Example: [twinings is better] Disappointed. Wanted to give it a try but flavor is not as good as Twinings. Costing the same as Twinings.
Example: [Redundance] I like the characters in Debbie's books but she is redundant in her descriptions of the characters very chapter or two.
Example: [unleashed] this album is wak! the whole bow wow concept in itself is lame this album has sunk to a new low even for him!dont waste your money on any one of bow wows albumbecause they all have one thing in common they allhave a corny sound to them!
Example: [Excellent Primer] I heard about this product several years ago and love it. Not sure if it helps with wrinkles but love it as a makeup primer. My face feels like velvet and keeps me feeling young all day. This is a must have for my daily makeup kit!
Example: [Wonderfully odd tales from the same city] The best way to read this book is to know nothing about it beforehand. Maupin has crafted a creepily odd and seductive psychological mystery that needs to tap into your sense of innocence and surprise; it is what you must bring to the read. At more than one point I was caught up with the "Wow!" of the plot. Maupin manages to mix the inventive and the autobiographical in a way that lends resonance to both elements, and if his emotional nakedness does not unsettle you, the strangeness of the story will pull you in.
Example: [I want more] These shoes are so comfortable, you'd think you're wearing nothing at all. Its also skid resistant which is a big plus! I'd tell everyone who asks me about it to go and buy it then again I also dont want everyone to have the same shoe design as me.I'd buy this shoe even at its original price!
Example: [Very Disappointing] I have not written a review before but this toy was so disappointing I had to save others from making the same mistake I did. Our Buckaroo will buck sometimes but it takes at least 10 tries to get his back feet down to play the game. It is something only an adult with just the right touch can do. Very frustrating for everyone. Please do not waste your money on this toy.
Example: [Best since "This Perfect World"] A great album. If there was an option for four-and-a-half stars I would have used it. Incredible songs as always, but what sets this one apart from the last couple is the diversity--akin to "Can You Fly" and "This Perfect World". For that reason, I can't imagine growing tired of it. And it's not just the varied instrument selection and production choices that make these songs so refreshing. The type of writing in the songs themselves varies from the specifically detailed stories--which he happens to be the modern master at--to the more ambiguous "Anyone", to the spare use of words in "Arriving On A Train" in which he lets the music tell the rest of the story. And the more unique strands of Freedy we get the better.
Example: [Chain saw chain] This chain was ordered for a Poulan electric chainsaw. It arrived promptly and in perfect condition. I am pleased with this product.
Example: [A wonderful remake of a wonderful show] One of the great things about this album is how the performances really capture the energy and wit behind Sondhiem's clever lyrics, and wonderful music.Each of the performers goes above and beyond that which they are called upon to do, and the singing becomes infectous. Nathan Lane is wonderful as the scheming Pseudoulus and each line is delivered with such a duality that it never becomes boring to listen to.This is the next best thing to actually seeing the show, and holds a place in my collection as one of my favorites. Wonderful.
Example: [In response to Ashton] Just because they play "math metal" like Tool does doesn't make them the master musicians that Tool is. Dream Theater also uses mathematical signature changes and I don't see any comparisons. I'll admit that the bass player is good, but as for the other musicians... well, they aren't the "best" as you claim. Check out Peter Lingrine (sp? sorry) and Mikael Akerfeld from Opeth for two amazing guitarists, and Slayers Kerry King for another amazing guitarist, Slayers Tom Araya for a better screamer, and Slayers Dave Lombardo for a better drumber.
Example: [Nice way to fill the hole] It's a nice way to fill the hole left by removing the factory stereo. Fits fine and gives you another place to store things.
Example: [Moved to tears every time I read it.] How beautiful! We all are imperfect, crippled in some way. Yet it is those imperfections that God uses best.This is not only a wonderful Christmas story to cherish, but a story to read to children, who are disappointed because they did not make the cut for a sports team, or who feel unpopular, or don't have the best grades even though they try hard. If you are a parent or grandparent, you should be reading this one with children in your lap and tissues nearby. This one is not just for children, it is a classic story for all ages!
Example: [terrible buy] I agree with the other reviewers - I was really disappointed. This too slim volume - especially for the price - is designed for a 5 year old - and a simple one at that. Not a good buy - WAY too little info and annoying hand drawn illustrations- all in all a terrible buy.
Example: [Lousy] This story couldn't keep me interested. The plot wasn't developed enough, the romance wasn't interesting. Skipped through most of the book, never found anything readable after reading the first 80 pages or so.
Example: [Cool Book!] I have owned this book before. It is very cool. I particularly like the Ninth Psalm of Yog-Sothoth and the Ritual of the Silver Key.
Example: [2-3 inches too small!] Others have said it well: but the box, find other liners. These are a couple of inches shorter than they need to be to extend over the lip enough to stay put. And, they're not particularly strong. My cat shreds them or pulls them down to cover her "deposit" ... the later leaves a fresh deposit on top of the liner. Clevercat can do better!
Example: [wwatch] good quality and value. Nice looking. Don't like the bi-lingual days of the week. Day and date are very hard to see
Example: ["This film has been modified from its original version ...] ... It has been formatted to fit this screen."That's the first thing you'll see when you start watching this DVD. The movie itself is pleasant enough, if somewhat derivative. The best thing about it is probably the cinematography of London and the English countryside, but you won't be seeing 30% of the picture in this cropped, full-screen, full-price DVD release. Disgraceful.For some reason, the very last scene in the movie is shown widescreen, so you'll get an idea what the DVD would have looked like if it had been released by a studio that cared about its creative artists or its customers. If only.
Example: [Get a different book] I had to use this book for a sophomore class in college and let me tell you, this is the worst book ever written. Every time I would read this book, I would immediately fall asleep within 10 minutes. Then, I would wake up and try to read some more and fall back asleep. This book threw my whole sleep schedule off and I'm not exaggerating. First, the book is hard to follow. Second, when the author tries to describe something or use an analogy, it makes no sense whatsoever. Some of the vocabulary exercises at the end of each chapter aren't even covered in the chapter. Luckily, I already knew 90% of the topics covered in this book and still got an "A" in the class, but I would suggest buying a different book unless this book is required in one of your college courses.
Example: [Great Concept, Horrible Finish] I read this book because the back cover copy was intriguing. The first half of the book was great, and peaked my interest...But its as if the author stepped aside and let a clueless idiot finish the book...The "Beast" rapes the girl then just walks away...and the girl is fine with it, and gives it up to her boyfriend immediately after? Was this some kind of comedic porno???If an unknown author submitted this garbage to a literary agent/publishing house it would be thrown in the garbage immediately.This book goes to show that well known authors can publish anything and people will buy it.Thank God it was short and I only wasted an hour and a half reading it
Example: [Who looks older: Hunt or Midler?] I agree with all the critical comments here: the plot is hackneyed and painfully predictable; Hunt keeps playing the same role over and over; Firth must've needed the money; Broderick is over the hill; I also agree with the positive reviews, in particular those who note that Bette was the one bright spot. I just couldn't make it to the end. All I could think about was how bad Hunt looked; is she anorexic?. Something seriously wrong here: Bette was born in 1945, Hunt in 1963! While I admire Hunt for her work offscreen getting the book made into a film, I'm afraid it wasn't worth the effort. I'm glad I got this through Amazon Prime. If I had paid for it, I would be annoyed more than I already am for wasting one hour on this film. Admittedly, this wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but it sure wasn't the best!
Example: [Stupid Book] I am shocked to read the other reviews. As another reviewer stated, there is only one word per page and they don't rhyme or even make sense. This book was a HUGE disappointment. I have literally hundreds of childrens books and this one is going to the Goodwill. The words are like, Ball... Oops. Why is the ball an oops? How did it go through the window? This book is just lacking in everything. Don't waste your money.
Example: [a hidden gem] Tried to find this book in a bookstore, and it appears to be self-published, but available online. I can find nothing about the author at all. No matter, this is without doubt the funniest and most unique book I've read in years. It's hard to pin down the story - it's more a free-flight fantasy into the minds of marginally functional people desperately clinging to their version of happiness, fighting the insanity of the `normal' people that surround them. If you ever wanted to laugh at the concept of `coping', this is the book for you. It's great to see a writer on the outermost fringe of publishing produce this sort of work.
Example: [Like it but......] My teenage son was bugging me to give him my Kindle 1 and was very thrilled when the Kindle 2 came out so I would buy it. I really like the Kindle 2, but for $359, why on earth does it not come with a cover? C'mon Amazon, this is a hefty investment in your product and you should have sent a cover with it. I am not impressed with the Amazon cover (which costs another $30) so plan to buy the M-Edge cover, which takes 2-3 weeks to ship. Now I am hesitant to take my new Kindle on vacation - I don't want to risk getting it damaged on the way.
Example: [im only giving it one star because you have to...] ok..to the "brilliant" people who made this...just like most of the MWC fans on here ive been waiting for a season set of MWC...i hear about this piece ...and i thought "hey! they finaly released MWC on DVD woooooo!!!!!"and come to find out..ITS ONLY 5 EPISODES!!! ON ONE DVD TO TOP IT!!!!!i have to agree..why is it that they can release shows like "buffy" and "freinds" but they cant release MWC!!it just proves that alot of these companys dont want to spend time on real classic tv shows..i mean sure theres seasons of the simpsons,M*A*S*H,hogans heros,etc..but theres more "modern" seasons then there are clasics..they wont even spend time on a wonder years dvd collection!but they will for "freinds"!so people...please save your money! hope that we will see a season of MWC on dvd..NOT 5 MEEZLY EPISODES!this is a piece of garbage..you (the fans) want a season...not this 5 episode piece of jargon!"lets rock!" al bundy
Example: [Attention getter] Just put it on a table and watch who picks it ups and starts reading. If you have a quirky sense of humor then this book is for you. Definitely not a page turner, more like, just open it up and enjoy! A friend gave it to me and I have enjoyed watching everyone from my mom to my nieces get a giggle out of any one of the pages. It is the definition of a coffee table book. Buy it and enjoy!
Example: [Clumps, but smells and tracks.] Clumps hard enough for scooping, but there is little to no odor coverage. My cat is long-haired and this stuff is ALWAYS caught in his fur and feet. I have to clean him and sweep the floors after every use-- it's very lightweight and flaky, I assume this is why it's always in his fur.
Example: [Fantastic album] This is a wonderful album. It's very mellow in that the songs are mostly ballads and mid-tempo. It's also a modern country album, but retains a little bit of traditional country. "Ashes By Now" and "Does My Ring Burn Your Finger" are traditional, but not too traditional for me to enjoy."Does My Ring Burn Your Finger" is the best song on the album and my favorite; the opening guitar work in the beginning is so magnificent that I keep putting that part on repeat, and her drawl expresses the attitude in the song. I love sassy attitude songs. :)The rest of the songs have enjoyable melodies except for "Lonely Too," which doesn't stand out. "The Healing Kind," "Why They Call It Falling," and "Stronger Than I Am" are especially touching ballads.This is a very smooth album and it keeps the mellow mood throughout, even on the faster tempo songs. It's a fantastic album.
Example: [Awesome with Ceton infinitv 4 , Drops it 20C] I got this because myCeton InfiniTV 4 Digital Cable Quad-tuner Cardwas getting hot , I put it Directly under it and my Temps went from around 65C to 42C at half Speed which is a huge drop in terms of PC component partsOne negative is at full speed (there is a slider for Speed control) it is really loud but at 1/2 speed where i run it is is not bad at all if not noticeableIt does glow blue which is cool i guess if you have a case that shows it but my case is closed so i don't notice it at all and that's better for me
Example: [Safe, comfortable, and easy to use] After contemplating convertible car seats for a few months while my daughter was still in her infant seat, I decided to order a Britax Marathon. I liked the fact that it would allow me to keep her rear-facing much longer than most seats (up to 33 lb.) and that it would allow me to keep her in a 5-point harness longer than most seats (up to 65 lb.).The built-in lockoffs have been handy when installing the seat in vehicles that would require a locking clip otherwise. The seat cover and comfort foam are very plush (we have the Houndstooth print seat cover) and comfortable. My daughter has always been very comfortable in her Marathon, even on longer trips.
Example: [Fun for a while...] My daughter has loved this soother for almost a year now, but we just discovered that it's been leaking. I thought that the water was evaporating, as the level was lower over the last month, but I discovered liquid dripping out last night. There are no breaks or cracks in the plastic; the liquid is coming from the seams. It doesn't smell like water (kind of plasticky), and, while I'd like to believe it's probably non-toxic, I'm still not going to leave the soother inside my daughter's crib.
Example: [Laughably dated] What everyone seems to miss in this tenditious tome is that it was based on Huey Long and was intended to derail his White House express. For a much superior roman a clef on the Kingfish, read Warren's ALL THE KING'S MEN -- even though it also is very loosely based on HPL's exploits.
Example: [It's better than most litter boxes....] But it's not "the" perfect litter box. Litter tends to leak out the sides when you roll it over. Sometimes, wet litter sticks to the bottom so you have to bang the bottom to get it to fall off. Next, if your cat's stool is a bit runny, and they don't bury it properly, it sticks to the sides and makes a big mess. It's difficult to scoop if you do find this situation before rolling because the entry hole is small. My larger cat tends to only step in half way so his stool is half on the floor.Although rolling most days is easier than scooping, it does go faster when you are in a hurry. If you have cats with perfect litter behavior and don't mind sweeping litter spillage, this may just be a good buy for you.
Example: [This book is sad and depressing.] I gave this book to my 9 year old daughter to read. She started it without me. She told me how sad and awful it was. I decided I should read it with her. She was right. As the story progressed, I was hopefull that the story line would become more positive and encouraging. That just didn't seem to happen. After reading a chapter, last night, I've decided to put the book down and not finish. It was extremely violent and upsetting to the point where I didn't want to even continue. This book is not for children, and not for me either.
Example: [Does the job] It does what it's meant to. Sometimes loses suction and falls off but not often enough to be a huge nuisance.
Example: [Star Trek Voyager] I have the full series on DVD, but since they are not HD they look good on my HD TV.I also have Netflix, again ok.On Amazon streaming there is an HD option, and the series looks great.
Example: [All Our Yesterdays] I bought this cd for one track really "Dancing In The City" and it hassome great other tracks, "Uptown Top Rankin" and "Motorbike Riding" are brilliant.
Example: [Love It] This is great music to fall asleep with if you like Bach or classical music. Very restful and soothing. I often have trouble sleeping, but this does the trick for me. The entire CD is over an hour long so you have ample time to wind down and drift off into to a peaceful sleep.
Example: [Soft, Squishy, gives you a good Grip] It's a little hard to put on, but once it's on you'll forget that it's there. I don't know how well it will handle being removed to change the batteries. Hopefully it will flex without ripping. Colors do improve the look.
Example: [Neck duster? Neck scratcher is more like it.] This brush has a skinny, skimpy tuft of very stiff boar hair whose ends are not trimmed to a uniform length. The sensation of having one's neck brushed with it is quite unpleasant. My memories of the barbershop of my youth is that the neck brush was a soft and soothing finish to my haircuts; this is the polar opposite. It's going back.
Example: [Some helpful suggestions but also some thoughts dated 50 years back...] I got the audio book and listened to it while driving to work. Although hearing some good points on unrealistic expectations I couln't believe my ears when I heard that "day care is the modern version of child abandonment" and that "feminists have messed up so many things"... The author seem to be suggesting to half of her radio audience to give up the double-income model and move to a little town in the middle of nowhere far away from all temptations... It makes me wonder what kind of relationship the author experienced with her own parents and I'm pretty sure I know what Freud would say about this... Overall quite disppointing.
Example: [Great Story. Loved the Symbolism.] I have been a Frank Peretti fan since I first read "This Present Darkness." "House" continues in the same vein with a horror story about the unseen spiritual world. Wars between angels and demons battling for the souls of men. As with most books-to-movies, the books was more detailed and better. The movie had to leave too many things out. But overall, it was a good movie.
Example: [Exciting time travel adventure.] This book is an exciting Sci-Fi adventure involving both time travel and the lore of Atlantis. After reading this book it is easy to see how the author can take sequels in many different directions. This author shows great imagination and the novel was flawlessly edited by an expert.
Example: [If you don't speak French look elsewhere] They never mention that it doesn't have English subtitles. If you don't speak French, pass this one by! It's probably a wonderful movie if you can understand what's going on.
Example: [I would bye the blue one] I got this lava lamp for my brother for fun "because it was so cheap" I recomand the blue because the bubbles are pretty much white and there easy to see. My brother is scared of the dark and keeps the light on 24/7, and the bulb is still fine. They have better but huge ones at "big lots" i don't know if they sell them anymore "anyway there 40 dollars there" I would bye one and give it a try you'll enjoy it, it isn't that big of a deal.
Example: [HORRID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!] I agree with all of the other reviewers in this category, The Ultimate Sin sucked!!! The production, music, lyrics, everything just was way below what Ozzy was capable of. However, at the time, this was a very popular album. Also, the tour was huge. This was Ozzy's glam moment. Gotta remember that this is the type of music folks wanted to hear at the time, including me (sad, I know).Unfortunately, with the exception of No More Tears, all of Ozzy's stuff since Bark at the Moon has sucked!!! Whats up with that? He is still good live, but the new material really lacks.
Example: [GREAT COFFEE BUT BREAKS] I agree with the rest of reviews, Brews great coffee, but likes to break after nine months to a year!!!!
Example: [Still Good] I picked up his first album Domestic Blues several years back after listening to in a record store. About wore it out, really enjoyed the acoustic guitar and mandolin sound mixing folk, country and blues.Had all but forgotten about Bap until I saw him open up for Mark Knopfler last week. They had his new disc for $15 bucks there and once again I'm wearing it out. Nicely produced mellow blend of original songs that I can't get out on m head. Now I'm gonna have to look for the ones I missed.Highly recomended!
Example: [My board couldn't live without it!] If you do your MXR homework, you will find that this pedal is the 'Best of Both Worlds.' With the 'script' button out you get the modern (block MXR logo) phasing. With the 'script' button in, you get the classic 'script MXR logo' sound. The 'block' sound is a more enhanced, full-range phase, while the 'script' sound is a more subtle phase.It's really like two phasers in one.I really only use this to play early VH, with the script button in and the knob between 9 and 10. It VERY accurately replicates that early VH sound. I also use it to play Paul Gilbert's 'Fuzz Universe' with the knob at about noon.I found it better to use this pre-amp vs. FX loop as the phasing was VERY IN YOUR FACE and enhanced in the loop. Placed preamp this gives you a nice subtle phase: You know it's on, but it's not overpowering.I've tried my fair share of phasers and this one really knocks out the competition. Great bang for your buck and a phenomenal sound.!
Example: [Not what I expected] I grew up in the 50's and used to sing along with a lot of records, so I know what the music sounded like. There are 20 songs on this CD, and only 7 of them are the original beautiful recordings. The other 13 songs are sung by someone else, and unrecognizable. Their music quality is very flat and tinny and goes in and out. And there were no samples to listen to. I returned this CD, and am trying to find a good one.Don't buy this CD. It is MORE than half bad!
Example: [College Cult Classic!] This Movie Is A Must See For Any College or University Student Who Is Majoring In Accounting, Finance, or Business. That being said, most of what goes on in this film, is basically an entertaining story line that has a little bit of drama and mystery. I love the Ben Affleck pep talk scenes. I love the "Recko" scene (classic comedy). I love the Wall Street scene. Maybe this film is what lead up to some of the anticipation for "Money Never Sleeps"...who knows? But Never The Less, Boiler Room is a classic in it's own right. And most of all, it's unforgettable. Nia Long is super sexy (not plain Jane). Her character gave the film a different layer substance which was very nice & fresh to see.
Example: [Bad Quality] It took longer to receive this item than it to fall apart. Mirror fell off as i was driving to work.
Example: [Awesome] Man o Man! You just have to hear this! It starts out saying, Today is Sunday and we've got the greatest Gospel Singer in the world! WOW is right! Then at the end when you hear the crowd cheering her on, it's so moving it'll make you cry.
Example: [very good gun] all i can say is very good gun my older brother gave it to me and it had been his for like five years already haven't had any problems dispite its long time of use
Example: [Too Difficult to Use] Yes, these are soft, but they're also not paper towels you can grab for a quick spill. You need TWO hands to get these off the roll. Its like static/velcro. I hate these, and bought the bulk pack, so I have a ton to still use. Give me the traditional, rougher easy to rip towels anyday. Would not buy again!
Example: [Diaper Cake] the product was not as pictured it was all apart in the boxthere was no bear or a stuffed animal they might have put the wru\ong order in the box but supposly the refunded my money I need to wait to see the bill
Example: [Precise and Concise] This is the most precise and concise macroeconomics textbook I have ever seen. I especially appreciate the abundance of colourful figures drawn, which makes it highly suitable for beginners of macroeconomics. For beginners, a good textbook should include the elements that are attractive to dummies. Unlike the other typical macroeconomics textbooks (which are wordy and lengthy), this book adopts the "to-the-point" appraoch which stimulates the readers' reading incentive. And you can finish the whole book in a very short time!Although it is intentionally for undergraduates, it is also suitable for anyone who have done the first course of microeconomics.LAW Ka Chung
Example: [OUT OF THIS WORLD...YOU GO GIRL] Loving all of Chante's music, she seems to write songs that touch moments in your life. We all know that there have been well written songs but the artist was not equally matched. Chante can sing anything and it will be beautiful. Enjoying this CD and waiting for the next.
Example: [Working for me!] I bought this book needing to get fit and loose some weight after nearly 3 months in bed with a back problem. I am now a little more than halfway through it and it is working well. Combined witha healthy diet I am losing weight. The exercise is also giving me more strength and stamina for my everyday life. I can now go out for a day with my husband without having to call a half after a couple of hours and be taken home.Worth twice the price!
Example: [I hate the clips] My rollers are constantly popping out of the clip holders from this set, regardless of me using more or less hair. Maybe there is a magical perfect portion of hair to roller ratio. If so it is impossible to find. I dunno, but I do know I would NOT recommend these. Also even when I get these to stay in my hair, my hair doesn't curl nearly as much as it usually does in hot rollers. Overall buy something else.
Example: [Worse Than Legend!] I should know better by now than to trust a Mark Dacascos movie. This film is an insult to Matheson's orginal story. Dacascos' acting hasn't improved a bit. Even his kung-fu skills seem to be fading away.I'm so tired I don't even want to finish this review, so I'm not . . .
Example: [Dreadful] This movie is absolutely terrible. Do not waist two hours of your life watching this film. Poor sub-titles, no action, and a little perverted, too. I'd rather sit in a doctor's waiting room than to have watched this movie.
Example: [Broken] This humidor was a gift for my Brother-In-Law, and arrived with the glass shattered. I was very disappointed, and will not order from this company again.
Example: [Excellent specific and general ideas] He is always good....great reminders and specific information as well as general affirmative statements..have not finished it yet
Example: [Standard Kundera: brilliant] The great thing about Kundera novels is that they say things. This is a big problem with a lot of novelists writing today--they aren't saying anything. Plot takes a backseat to what Kudera is saying, though the plot isn't bad. It is difficult to peel back the layers of Kundera's point, but--as the title shows--he's commenting on identity: the identity we create for ourselves and the identity we create for others in our own mind. The novel raises more questions than it answers, but that's the sign of a great novel. Isn't it?
Example: [A TOTAL WASTE......] This product does not stand up against trying to cut grass, let alone any kind of weed!! Don't waste your time or money on these or the seller who would not make themselves available for any inquiry.
Example: [Bad Player & Bad Service] Out of the box the Rio 800 was a lemon. It crashed on half the songs I loaded, the battery showed full when it was almost empty and, best of all, the people at Rio don't exactly respond quickly to requests for repair or exchange. The unit is sitting in a drawer while I wait for their Customer diService department to get back to me. Maybe I'm too impatient, after all, I emailed them barely a month ago.
Example: [it works!] We bought this product six years ago.............the Mazda MX5 vinyl top still looks new, and has kept its flexibility........yes, we garage it, and treat it like the classic it is.......recently renewed our supply thru Amazon.............same product, same ease of application. I love it when products do exactly as advertised!
Example: [Waste of time] I agree with all the negative things other reviewers have said about this book...interesting premise not executed well. A bunch of women who have nothing better to do but hang out in a knitting shop all day? Please. A white man who discovers that his grandfather was black and now must deal with the fact that he is an "African American"? Again, please. And the baby in question, of course, is fantastically beautiful with "golden" eyelids, etc. The people are one-dimensional and there are too many plot lines that are left hanging at the end. A really good novel about this topic would have been a treat. This is a throwaway beach read at best.
Example: [Let's Be Honest] This book has a religious orientation that is not revealed until you open it and start reading. I have no objections to religion for those who choose it, however, I resent the "hidden agenda" aspect of this book. If I had known in advance this was a religion-based book, I would not have bought it. I think that's the idea behind their keeping quiet about it.
Example: [There should be a "0 star" rating...] Regardless of your political views, this is a poorly thought out excuse for a film. Anyone with more than a room temperature IQ will quickly be disgusted by the filmmaker's pandering and patronizing.
Example: [NOT SO GREAT] This game is very difficult to play . has alot of gliches, you have to keep buying food and water to feed your dog, well before you know it its all gone and you have to go to the pet store again, I tried to help my granddaughter get the dog to do tricks and its literally impossible, all it will do is sit. I can not make it do anything else I have tried everything and I am 49 years old, so how can a child be expected to learn the dog tricks. I still can't figure out how it is suppose to get sleep zzzz, or get him to go in the dog house. The game is frustrating for any child.
Example: [Worse harlequin I've ever read] I really don't understand the 5 star reviews. Normally, I try to keep an open mind to others' likes/dislikes, but this is one case where I am completely baffled that anyone would like this.There is NO chemistry at all between any of the characters. He threatens her no less than 4 times by saying either "if you were a man, I'd hit you" or "I'll kill you". Normally when the H/H get 'busy' any semi-reluctance has long since been banished, it almost feels like he assaults her in this story.I just can't stress how horrible this book is.
Example: [Good for only a year give or take...] Well I loved this Fm radio adaptor for my nano but it's been almost a year and it started acting a bit funky till the next day it just stopped working completely. So if I were you, do not waste 45-50 dollars on this merchandise if it's not going to last. I love apple but the fact that they didn't want to give me another one makes me not want to buy there product. The reason they ask for more money for a 2 year guarantee is because their products will eventually stop working. THIS IS JUST A WARNING:)
Example: [It kind of sucks!!!] I see my first review wasn't posted, maybe I was too mean. So I'll just say for a British House music lover, this CD & the import is a let down. But check out the remixes that are out there......
Example: [Pretty Cool!] It's amazing that there are so many private stuff in this books. I think children should know about sex at a young age because it will happen to them when they get older, like age 8. Go books!
Example: [love these!] These sort of hurt a first but after a few wears they are easy to use. I wear them to sleep sometimes. I think they have helped to mitigate bunion formation in my right great toe. I also use them when I do my own pedicures. I'm glad I bought these as they are durable and effective and non invasive.
Example: [clearjel starch] this starch is easy to use and the batches of canned peach pie filling were beautiful. will get more next year.
Example: [Tired] Having lost faith and taken a skeptical approach to religion I was hopeful that this book would lead me into rethink.No way! Tired and inaccurate, not a waste of time though as I found myself constanly jumping up with "That's not true." "What a jump!" and that's a downright fabrication!"
Example: [Powell rocks..] I think Palmer was still drumming with Asia when they made this one, which explains the different drummer. Everything else you might expect is as close to pure ELP as you can get. "The Score" has Emerson's grand, energy-packed keyboard playing a la "Brain Salad Surgery." "Touch and Go" leans toward the tone of "Black Moon." This whole album is not quite their '70s sound or their '90s sound, but somewhere in between. Some songs capture the best of both, such as "Learning to Fly." If ELP hadn't broken up in 1979, this is what some of their 80s stuff might have sounded like.
Example: [Christmas present] Bought this for my son who just purchased a mandolin. Had to let him open it early to use for some special music at church. He said it made it so much easier to play. Looks nice too.
Example: [Oy! Not What I expected] What can I say....I love Kodo. But this was not Kodo. While I'm sure the remixer's, DJ's, Et`al, might have meant well...What they did to this album is a grave injustice to Kodo. The tracks were so remixed, distorted, folded, bent, stapled, and mutilated. That I thought the Postal Service had gone into the Music Recording Industry to supplement their profits... I couldn't tell if most of the tracks were based on Kodo's works or not for the most part... Next time Kodo allows remixers to use their works. They should definitely put it in the contract someplace. That the tracks should at least resemble their original compositions in a more identifiable fashion. I love techno as much as the next person, but this was even beyond my tolerance...Guess I'm just a purest at heart, when it comes to Kodo and their style of Tiako.
Example: ["after fight club, the volume gets tuned down(...)"] ...Well, the same could be said of Mr Palahniuk's inspiration lately.Here is a compilation of his writing which reads more like articles than essays : demolition, castles, marilyn manson, hollywood, ghosts, etc... it's more of a bazaar. Gonzo journalism somehow...I skipped a lot of chapters just like i pick the juicy parts in my newspaper.I enjoy very much Mr Palahniuk novels, but it's not because you have talent and you sell, that you must publish everything you write.If you're a fan, you'll buy it anyway.Otherwise, wait until it's in paperback or get it at your local library. The price is defenitly not worth it. His Portland, Oregon guide is at least much more fun to read.
Example: [Whatever!!!!] The contents of this book are extremely offensive. I'm a muslim and from my point of view this book is biased. Lewis generalizes way too much. Sure there are some muslim extremist but what religion doesn't come with it's share of bad apples? If Islam is so "evil" and whatnot then how come even today you find old churches from way back in muslim countries yet in christian or jewish countries you only find ruins of what was once mosques? It's because Islam is a tolerant religion, and always has been, that's why. Again, what religion doesn't come with it's share of fanatics?
Example: [Pretty good, but needs attention] The actual function w as great, I was putting together an amplifier, but the only problem I had was that the pins came out after a little tug. This tug wasn't that bad either, I had soldered wires to pins 1-6 and I pulled on pin 3 not vary hard(maybe at 5 lbs of force) and it just slipped right out. Not the best thing after some extensive solder work but good thing I got more than one. Good price and functionality is superb.
Example: [One of the Best Books of all Time] This book is a masterpiece of Truth and Light. You cannot put a price on it! God bless you M. for so faithfully capturing the words of a Master. I only have to read a few pages and I find myself so uplifted and blown away by the simplicity and depth with which eternal truths are captured. An essential book for those who are on the Path.
Example: [Weak in comparison...] The only valuable part of this book was the list of Japanese terminology in traditional Ju Jitsu, plus a decent history section. Overall, though, the number of moves they offer is miniscule compared to other books on the market, and the pictures are so infrequent that, in a photo sequence, I often had no idea how the person got from their position in Photo 1 to their position in Photo 2. It's actually pretty funny. You'll have some guy doing something -- and, next picture, they're in an entirely different position. With the recent spate of Ju Jitsu and BJJ books, this is very outdated and I think would serve only as a broad introduction (like an extended Encyclopedia article).
Example: [Just a fun movie] Sit back and enjoy this version of Holmes. They could be a little more clever and a little less high tech but the acting is first rate and maybe they can evolve into the head game masters that Holmes and Watson are in other iterations.
Example: [King of Hearts DVD] Movie itself is great. It was sent as a gift to friend in London who couldn't view it. Did I miss the zone information? and it came with no cover, only a sleeve. all in all the first unsuccessful purchase. alas
Example: [The deodorant had a nice scent and worked ...] The deodorant had a nice scent and worked well in keeping me dry. Even after a day, I could feel that it was still on me. I would recommend it to someone because it's a good product.
Example: [these guys are horrible and pretentious] I work for a radio station. These guys were all the rage a few years ago, so I was sent out to a concert to get the inside scoop. I hated the show. The guy is talentless: he can neither sing nor play the guitar. The lyrics are strained and mock-absurdist. The guy is visibly aching for attention--"Don't you people think I'm weird?" When I interviewed them after the show I felt like pissing the whole time so I was extra-irritated by things I would normally overlook--i.e., the guy kept scratching his hair like some eccentric and I was on the verge of spitting in his face. So, lucky me: I was asked to review this album by the station. . . you can imagine the long harangue I launched against this godawful band. But nobody seems to mind me.
Example: [sucked, actually] a bitter disappointment. like getting coal for christmas. the plot was flatter than the DVD itself, and the characters were cliches with british accents.
Example: [Far too big...] I ordered these hoping that I'd have some great new silk pajamas to replace mine that had worn out. Let me tell you, if you're a small person like I am these are not at all for you. You will be completely drowning in them. I looked like I was 5 years old and playing dress up in my mother's clothing; the small is not at all small... I was highly disappointed.
Example: [Perfect! Get ready for your Fantasy to unfold] I'm Britney's #1 fan, a guy, and not gay. But I still bought Fantasy and Curious because I get everything she puts out. This really is VERY sexy smelling and I plan on buying it for my girlfriend someday. It smells like a forest, then cupcakes, musk, and is extremely sexy. Girls: buy this and your boyfriends will love you. I was in a lunch line and I smelled the girl next to me wearing it's distinct scent. I was drawn to her. Get my drift? It works! Buy it!
Example: [Familiar format for seniors] I purchased this book for my senior parents who have in the past year bought not one, but two new computers. Brave as they are, computer jargon is new to them, and sometimes I am hard pressed to help them out long distance. It was great to find this book that looks SO MUCH like the red Reader's Digest Do-It-Yourself book that has occupied my father's bookshelves for as long as I can remember. That familiarity is bound to feel something like climbing a new mountain in a pair of comfortable old jeans.
Example: [Great product] This is a fantastic tool. Easy to use, and does cut down on shedding. A little pricey, but I believe it's worth it.
Example: [Gm blower motor] Hey this was a good buy! It was cheaper than auto zone, shipped free, was simple to install! Best part is that it works perfect!!!!!
Example: [The Codpiece of Doom] The blu-ray is kind of unnecessary, as the film stock used to shoot the movie is not digital film, but the features were fun, the movie is a classic... and it's cheaper on blu-ray than on DVD... so what are you waiting for? BUY THE MOVIE! :)
Example: [Upstate New Yorker] All her books are great reading!This one is really good!Would buy againWill definitely buy more!
Example: [Poor and disapointing] Typically for the British:1. Lack of objectivity2. Lack of humility3. Eagerness to blame the foreigners4. The nationalistic bias5. FEEL-GOOD atmosphere
Example: [A fair book] +AH4-This book is unusual. It's very boring at some parts (I fell asleep reading this book). There's only a few exciting parts but they wear off fast. You should try reading his better books first.+AH4-
Example: [Hobb is Burnt Out] After reading the 1st two books in Robin Hobb's Farseer Trilogy and enjoying them immensely, I was more than just a little disappointed in the 3rd volume. Hobb appears to have burnt out. He devotes pages and pages to boring pointless journeys, opens a promising theme - Old Blood - and never develops it and his evil king character develops a split personality, alternatly swinging from evil genius to drug addeled dilettante. I finished the book but it was so poorly done I had a real hard time not just chucking it part way thru.
Example: [Terrible PRODUCT-Whats going on with SONY DVD players] ALL current HDMI Upscale DVD players on the market are FIRST generation products and are all in need of work. However I cannot afford to waste money or time until they get it right. The HDMI connects looked great...it stopped working within 48 hours. So then I was left with only the progressive outlets working till I worked on returning this item. Then I noticed that the progressive connects (yeah they worked) but looked HORRIBLE. So I went back to my old sony 425P. I love this player and in my opinion is one of the GREAT dvd players sony has made 2+yrs and running strong.So please avoid this player read the rest of the reviews and wait for awhile till they submit a new model with HDMI connects
Example: [Good Ideas, Bad Writing] Reading through the table of contents shows a wide variety of prayers on topics from Prayer to the Dawn to Prayer to Save the Rain Forests. Unfortunately, the prayers themselves are dry and contrite. They state the spirtual need in a matter of fact, textbook way. No sense of artistic flow. For the Star Trek fans out there a good example of a poem Data might write.
Example: [Not the same as Ghiradelli] They are now made by a different company, TJerrild, located in Fresno, CA. They definitely do not taste the same as Ghiradelli. Supposedly they are made with the same ingredients, but I would say not the same recipe. A huge difference in taste form when I was a kid. Thanks for the memories Ghiradelli....
Example: [Important stuff but hard slogging] This is an encyclopedia, and reading such things is not what most people, even when deeply interested in the subject are likely to do. It does provide a fair reference for specific topics, but this is not a subject one can really pick and choose.VAR is the ususal starting point, and its famous authors (one of whom I hired for his skill in these matters) cover most of the bases in an interesting way.
Example: [Unless you love Zeppelin, there may be a better album foryou] I love this album.However, if you're looking for 'The Best of Zeppelin', look at 2, 3, 4/Runes, or Houses of the Holy. In fact, buy those first, this next, then Presence. The main attraction of this album for me is the song Kashmir, which made the purchase more than worth it.
Example: [A real letdown] I have all the Zen Garden recordings and this one is a total letdown. Do not buy this CD because it does not live up to the standards of previous Zen Garden albums. I use this music to help me sleep (due to chronic insomnia) so I am not asking for more than capably produced, relaxing sounds. This CD is just awful. Get Restful Earth instead, it is a much better disc.
Example: [If you want to be a better friend, read this book!] If you are looking to be a better friend to your closest friends, I highly recommend this book!
Example: [Useful at first, but not for long] We bought these books to teach us come finer aspects of Visual Test, and they do just that -- to an extent. Unfortunately, after the first several chapters, it quickly becomes useless, barely covering some very important aspects of the product (file I/O, pointers), and spending entirely too much time explaining how to test Wordpad. I would rather have a good reference for this product than this.It seemed a little half-baked. It was good in some areas, but for the most part lost usefulness quickly. I can't in good conscience give this any more than a mediocre review.
Example: [rainbow popsicles and diamond-paved streets] Music to go on a picnic to, or drive around to on a sunny day with someone you like a lot. Cub makes me feel cheery. . and wistfull. It's kind of like eating really good candy.
Example: [How do you get it to work?] I was really looking forward to seeing the art but I put the CD's in and nothing happened. At all! I knew it wasn't my computer and tried all of the CDs. What a disappointment. I returned it and hope to find something similar that works! Maybe I just got a bad set.
Example: [Flimsy Construction] The cylindrical housing around the lens is attached to the body in a very flimsy manner and comes out easily
Example: [Fifteen shades of manic fun!] I'll keep this short and sweet: I haven't had this much fun with a record in a VERY long time. I don't think they could've crammed any more influences into their sound if they wanted to. This CD is just sheer, unadulterated party music... "Kountry Genlteman" and "Luv Addict" are standouts, but there's not a yawner here! Put this in rotation at your next party and kick the good time up about two and a half notches!
Example: [Not worth it] Very disappointed with this pair of Apple Bottoms! I have several pairs and this one is not worth it. Neither the product description nor the pictures on the website give you a very close look at the jeans. Some of the "special details" make it seem as if the item were damaged. It doesn't look cool!
Example: [Bears in the Barn] I ordered this book for my granddaughter for christmas on Dec 3th and recieved it when I was informed of the shipping date. My granddaughter enjoyed this book very much. I had a very good experience with this company and would order again from Internationalbooks. Keep up the good service.
Example: [Ugh; not mysterious, thrilling, romantic or humurous--annoying and boring read] Ugh. This was the worst in the series by far; it was literally a chore to drag myself through the end. All the stuff about Eddie Kroll is just completely irrelevant and stupid and detracts from what's supposed to be the main story. Nina was also incredibly stupid and annoying, and as other reviewers have mentioned the killer was quite obvious and the resolution a mess. By the time I got to the end I was just finishing it to finish it and was completely unconcerned and uninvolved in what was happening. A terrible read; the first two (Cold Truth: A NovelandHard Truth: A Novel) are worth borrowing, but this one isn't even worth that. Lacks suspense, romance, mystery, humor--it doesn't have a single redeeming quality. Borrow the first two in the series, but this one isn't even worth that.
Example: [disappointing sound volume] I was surprised with the low volume level, especially after reading the reviews here. With the volume on my cell turned all the way up, the earpiece is still pretty quiet, and I even have trouble hearing some people at all. However, I am using the headset with an LG VX3300, which I suspect has a low powered external jack. But, even with a $10 inline Sony earpiece (with a regular earbud that doesn't go into the ear canal), the volume is higher. Also, people on the other end of the line hear me more clearly when I'm not using the headset.
Example: [Just Great!!!!!] I had been worked with VB a little before, then I got this book and it's....WOOOOAOAOAOAAAH! It gives a great base to the language, and something on its subset (VBScript/VBA/ASP).The book does get through a lot of things linked to the language, its components and things like that. However if someone wants to get 'professional' about a detail (eg: WinSock), one has to look elsewhere. This said, the background provided by this book makes understanding these 'extras' an easy thing.Having access to M$'s MSDN is an extra help (in this, and any M$ language/sytem), for refering to API's and 'hidden' details.
Example: [Non intuitive and full of bugs] After 3 days of intensive learning I still can't do some very basic things, it takes me sometimes hours of research to do the most simple things ... like gradient painting a circle object while it takes one intuitive action with my previous software to do that. I find Photoshop CS2 is too complexe in its structure, vocabulary and workflow philosophy for the occasional user. I reckon it takes at least 2 full weeks of training to manage this software, far too much in my opinion, I mean we're talking of image processing ... in comparaison it took me 1 week to manage Autocad and about 2 weeks for a FEA pro softaware.
Example: [WARNING TO PARENTS!!!] This series is intended for Ages 8 to 12 and this Book Two is TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE for this age group. There is graphic cruelty to animals which is even depicted in an illustration!!! The bad fairies catch a domestic cat and roast it on a spit! Children will either be traumatized or intrigued by it - both very BAD! There are too many good alternatives out there. Try these series: Chet Gecko Mysteries, Magic Tree House, Secrets of Droon, Animal Ark Series, A to Z Mysteries, Box Car Children, American Girl History Mysteries and the 3 Adventure series - Island, Dive, and Everest. Also books by Eva Ibbotson, Beverly Cleary, Judy Blume, George Selden, E.B. White, R. Dahl, Estes and Eager.
Example: [One of the best I have ever read!!!] Yoga for the New Millenniuma novel by Tamal Krishna GoswamiYoga for the New Millennium easily disposes of questions pondered by mankind for thousands of years. Travel with a young man on his journey of self - discovery and see how the timeless truths of the ancient yoga system are powerfully relevant today, at a time when humanity is seeking solutions to unprecedented problems.His Holiness Tamal Krishna Goswami is a world - renowned teacher and practitioner of yoga as presented in the ancient Vedas of India, such as The Bhagavad - gita. He has lectured internationally for over 30 years and his books have been translated into several languages.This soft bound book is 195 pages long. I personally couldn't put it down and feel that is is one of the most interesting and well written novels I have ever read. Fascinating, and intelligently done, I HIGHLY recommend this great book! Get it today!!
Example: [John's Recommendation] The Train is a very good movie that takes place during WW2. It portrays the Nazi's efforts to steal and ship the Art of France to Berlin by rail and how the French underground put a stop to it. A very good Movie.
Example: [Good book group material] I came upon this book inadvertently during some surfing on Amazon. I was intrigued by the reviews & ordered it. It is a wonderfully complex story that everyone in my book group praised. The author vividly presents the lives of the sandhoggers and masterfully interweaves the present day with the past.
Example: [Still the best energy modelling book] Good balance of intuition and technical details on modelling and pricing energy related derivatives. Very hands on discussion on the pros and cons of various approaches. Ideal for quants or quantitative traders with a good understanding of stochastic calculus and statistics.
Example: [Does not come with two extra wheels as it says it would] The product features says that the board comes with "Value Pack includes two extra wheels" however it does not.Product FeaturesGroundbreaking caster board that acts like a skateboard/snowboard hybridPivoting deck and 360-degree caster trucks enable snowboard-like carvingSpiked traction pads, kick tail and nose, and concave deck design76mm polyurethane wheels and precision ABEC-5 bearing casters; Value Pack includes two extra wheelsDesigned for riders age 8 years and up; supports up to 220 pounds
Example: [Fun...just fun to watch] This is a really creative idea--to make a period piece following the classic Lovecraft tale using the same film style that was present when the story was written. Just a brilliant move. I really like that this was made by members of the HP Lovecraft Historical Society as well. If you are a Lovecraft fan, and would like to see a film stylized to fit 1930's style of silent picture, get it. The art-deco Cthulu statue is a nice touch as well.
Example: [Fast and tight action story] Tight story telling and nerve breaking suspenseful action drama with solid performances!!One can see why Korean made movies are so popular in all over the Asian regions these days!!!
Example: [Battery dead in 5 months] Bought these for our sports team on December 6. Five months later the batteries are dead even though it is advertised with a 1.5 year battery life. Looks like they were manufactured in 2009. There is no tab to pull out to start the battery running the watch so it is running before you receive it. They take an LR43 Maxell battery and you have to remove 5 tiny screws to change the battery. I wouldn't buy it again. It does work properly, though, until it dies.
Example: [Not what was promised] I do not buy Library Discards.This book was supposed to be "like new" (even the sticker on the back cover says so) and said nothing about a library discard.The book is in poor cover condition, the pages are very yellow and it is most definitely a library discard.I will not be able to use it in our library so this was a total waste of money!I will not be purchasing from this seller again.
Example: [A great piece of history and musical history] One night I was going through my music of the 40's and re-discovered Jane Froman singing WITH A SONG IN MY HEART. After shedding my goosebumps I remembered that it came from an Academy Award movie in my young days. I did an online search and up it came. I didn't even dream it was still available. But Amazon had it. I ordered it because my very musical granddaughter has grown to love movie music and broadway. I would love to hear her sing this song. And what a great way for a young person to piece together some WWII history and showbiz history and radio history at the same time.Thank you Jane for your music and your commitment to the USA. Thank you Amazon for having it.Dick Pickensretired dj
Example: [perfect] I can't use a blade on my face, it irritates my skin. I've tried a lot of electric trimmers. this one by far is the closest shave I have ever had with an electric. it's tiny. it's not unreasonably loud like some other reviews say, it's an electric trimmer, they make noise, big deal. I only write reviews if something is awesome or awful. these trimmers are awesome. if it ever breaks, I'm buying the same one again.
Example: [BRING IT BACK ON DVD!] My sister and I used to watch this movie among all others when we were little. Not only did we love the Lyle Lyle Crocodile books, but when a friend of the family sent us a homemade copy on VHS of this animated version of The House on East 88th St, it quickly became a new favorite. Fortunately, I still have that tape in my attic, but my VCR has been in the landfill for years, since it's kaput. I want it not only for myself, but I have a friend who just had a kid, and they too will need a copy of this first-rate cartoon musical. PLEASE BRING IT BACK!
Example: [Pretty good workout!] I consider myself to be in good shape and I workout by either running 5 miles or DVD's such as Insanity/Bob Harper/Jillian Michael's 5-6 days a week. This DVD is fun and not as hard as those mentioned but works up a good sweat and I love how it is broken up into 10 min segments. I am definitely interested in trying more 10 min Solution DVD's to add to my rotation!
Example: [Good enough to please !] Finished this book in a day. OK it is not classic but it is fun read, with a plot exciting enough to keep me flipping the pages. I know this is fiction but Brown should have tried harder to get his facts right. I am an admirer of the great genius, Michelangelo and Brown has definitely erred in his reference to this great artist's works. First Michelangelo was not the architect of any stair case in the Vatican City. Second the Vatican does not possess any male nude sculpture by Michelangelo, with its stony penis removed . Dan's errors is irritating and a trifle irresposible. Still Angels & Demons is great entertainment and will not be my last book by this writer.
Example: [Did not last long] I had this unit for a little over one year. The refrigerant coil started leaking just after the warranty ran out. Had to junk it. Would not recommend.
Example: [Great tool] Excellent tool for learning the techniques and licks of this album, author should do a few other. Highly recommended.

Example: [Warning! Major errors in this title] I'm just wrapping up my National Boards, and have found several major errors is this book. (Sort of a surprise, considering the publishing company and the "New! Updated!" sales pitch.) One is where she comments she's "reluctant to share her own entries with her candidates." Sharing actual entries is against the code of ethics for trainers. On page 42 she references a 15 minute video tape for entry one. Nope, no video for that entry. I did use some of the other pieces, but not as many as some of the other books available.
Example: [The MXZ saw is a piece of junk] When I watched a demontration of this saw cutting through all different types of material like metal, glass and brick I was amazed and at such a great price. When I received it and tried to cut a small to medium sized branch I did not have the same success. It is like a butter knife more than a saw. After half an hour trying to cut this branch, I finally gave up. I must admit, I wish I had the saw they were showing on the TV advertisement. The one I have is definitely not it. This is a piece of junk. I only wish I could get my money back. Best I can tell, it won't cut through anything.
Example: [AS EXPLOSIVE AS THE SNEEZE OF A SQUIRREL] When I was watching this movie, I found myself going through a mental list of what I needed to do the next day, what we were going to have for breakfast the next morning and hoping this movie would end soon. Wesley Snipes is about exciting as watching the rinse cycle on a washing machine, the plot is so convoluted and incoherent, and the action sequences look like they came out of a movie catalogue. Ho hum, indeed.
Example: [This is a very good item,a very good tool to use.] This is a good book to read, relearn and this is a good price to buy.This is a very good item,a very good tool to use.This is a very good item,a very good tool to use.This is a very good item,a very good tool to use.This is a very good item,a very good tool to use.This is a very good item,a very good tool to use.This is a very good item,a very good tool to use.This is a very good item,a very good tool to use.This is a very good item,a very good tool to use.This is a very good item,a very good tool to use.This is a very good item,a very good tool to use.This is a very good item,a very good tool to use.
Example: [Don't Bother] I thought this movie was awful. I like Jennifer Aniston, but the story stunk, the characters were seedy. ick. Don't Bother.
Example: [Great watch] This is a replacement for an Ironman - great watch with many functions. Really can't believe they can pack this much into it for the price.
Example: [Not only DID NOTwork...] I installed it and immediately had issues reconnecting an Ethernet bridge to my wireless router. I was also unable to login to work over a VPN connection after the install. I had to uninstall the software in order to connect things back up.The documentation was beyond my understanding.
Example: [the runner] I thought the runner was an alright novel. Cynthia Voigt is a good author but this book was hard for me to understand. Due to the fact that you have to be in bullets position. I personally can not put my self in his position so I was confused. But even though it confused me she did a good job writng it. It is a book for people that can put themselves in oter peoples position. If there is any body that can do that than I would highly suggest to read this book.
Example: [Dehydrator] Overall seems to be a good product. Like the temperature control and the ability to add trays. My husband uses it for drying morels and I can't wait to try it with my strawberry's in a couple weeks.
Example: [disappointing battery life] Needed another replacement battery for my aging iBook G4 and took a chance, as the price was definitely right. However, the lifespan of this battery has left a lot to be desired. Within the first two months, the battery was fine, but it just never seemed to work correctly - the charging indicator would always indicate "charging" even afer I knew the battery should have been fully charged. By 6 months out, the battery would only hold a charge for about 20 minutes. By now - less than one year - the battery holds about a 9 minute charge and gives no warning at all before just dying out. The Mac is still a good machine and I will need yet another battery, but I can't say it will be one of these Tech Orbit batteries.
Example: [NOT Recommended for Quick Conversational Learning] With an upcoming trip to Spain, and no knowledge whatsoever of Spanish, I ordered this set hoping to learn enough Spanish to get by.The first sixty or so lessons were isolated repetitions of lists of words with no contextual phrasing or conversation whatsoever. My knowledge of French and Italian helped with those Spanish words that have similarities in those other languages, but otherwise, by the time I got to subsequent lessons, it was almost impossible for me to recall the bulk of the Spanish words dictated in the earlier lessons.My wife, who took Spanish in school, found the lessons to be good refreshers, but also agreed that they did not serve well as a pre-vacation immersion course.Anyone wishing to quickly learn conversational Spanish should ignore the glowing reviews below and consider obtaining a course that uses the immersion method (i.e. where you listen to everything IN CONTEXT rather than in isolated dictate-pause-dictate list fashion).
Example: [Throbbing Epistles!] This is probably the most listenable of the TG albums that I have yet to hear. "What a Day" is clearly one of the highlights of this album, mainly because it features an excellent sample of an inmate at some penitentiary talking to adolescents about the rigors of prison life (a la Scared Straight). "Leeds Ripper" is also a perennial favorite as is the first track on the album and "Her Arm Was Her Leg". Whatever anybody has to say about TG in terms of musical ability/talent will always sound a bit presumptuous to me (especially if the criticism happens to be negative or derogatory). TG seems to have been first and foremost conceptual art/cultural terrorism interested in exploring/exploiting conventions and cultural mores in an attempt to discover what lies beyond the frontiers of acceptability. Music just happened to figure into the equation as a means of achieving specific ends. Well, if you're interested in the TG sound I would recommend this album and also Dimensia in Excelsis.
Example: [Way above and beyond what you need to know!] Sorry I bought the book. I could not even use this book. After reading the Todd Lammle books from Sybex and the CCNA Exam Cert Guide from Cisco Press, I started looking at these questions... Wow! where did they get this stuff... It was scary! CCNA is suppost to be a basic certification. These questions were written for gurus (and some of them may have trouble). If you like shock therapy, then this book is for you.
Example: [Not what I expected.] This is one of the times that I am really kicking myself for not getting the sample. Is this really considered a book? There's not a bit of storyline here. I really loved the Carrie Diaries and came into this book with expectations maybe a little higher than it deserved. Okay, a lot.
Example: [nice but short] I had been looking to replace my OXO Good Grips flexible Spatula that I gave to my mother in law. Though I found that same one, I went with this cheaper option. With shipping it ended up being about the same and I wish I had brought the original version. The blade on this one seems very sharp - not the case in my old OXO. It does the job, but I was able to use my old one on a nonstick frying pan to flip for over easy eggs without any issues. With the sharp edge I believe this one will scratch up my pan. I say pay the extra $3 or 4 and get the OXO one. This is also much shorter that the other one and I didnt pay attention to any details about length. Not meant for someone with big hands.
Example: [Terrible synthpop with even worse vocals!] A warning for the wise: Do NOT waste your money on this CD. The instrumentals are mediocre at best. Extremely generic. And the vocals are just plain terrible. Mr. Miller sounds extremely amateurish on the recordings, and if Rui wants to salvage the band, he would do well to find a new singer. Carol Masters' EP is truly disappointing.
Example: [WOKA-WOKA!] Owning this wok has changed my eating habits. I now enjoy a much healthier diet and it's fun to use. I've tried a few different woks and this one stands out. Its great heat dissipation cooks fast and evenly and although Circulon's ribbed, non-stick surface is not found on traditional woks, it works as well here as on their skillets and pots. A perfect marriage of new technology and old!
Example: [This is what Maiden should have evolved into.] After hearing this c.d., it's obvious that Bruce didn't have as much say into the direction of Iron Maiden as he should have. (No offense to Steve Harris). This c.d. has added elements and color that Iron Maiden NEVER had - an all accoustic song, a REALLY heavy rhythm section, and an even mix of the instruments! Don't get me wrong, I love Maiden up through Seventh Son, but Mr. Harris can be a little narrow minded. His over-mixed bass playing tends to take away from the heaviness of the riffs. (Imagine driving a fast car over a bunch of speed bumps).As for Accident of Birth, I really can't pinpoint the standout songs, 'cause they all stand out. Roy Z does a remarkable job! I saw this tour when I was in Minnesota, and it's a real shame that they were playing in small bars and clubs. This c.d. is one of the highlights of the '90s!
Example: [What a great product!! So many episodes!] Really like Poirot and this made my collection! There are so many episodes of Poirot. It took my wife and I a month to watch one a day, which was our goal and something to look forward to each day. Plus there are so many that we can see them again without having to watch the same ones over and over. David Suchet does a great job in these!
Example: [This is getting interesting] The review from Stephen Nichols reads exactly the same as the one by Linda Tanner Nichols which appeared the day the book was published but presumably pulled recently. What's going on?
Example: [WELL DONE BUT KINDA OBVIOUS] THE PORNOGRAPHER (Koch Lorber) is Betrand Bonello's explicit and controversial portrait of Jacques, a once famous and acclaimed -- but now burned out -- 50 year old pornographer from the 70s who tries to get back in the business of erotic films for the bucks.However, he soon sadly discovers that he has lost his passion personally and professionally and must examine his own life and the trajectory that has brought him to this place. Jacques descends into a lonely isolation as he disconnects with his son, two ex-wives and finally himself.Be warned, there's brief but very explicit sex.
Example: [A Useful Book] This book is very useful in studying the meanings of planets in signs and houses. It is simple, easy to use, and written in easy to understand English.
Example: [Banjo with Eddie Adcock] Must be a good player to understand what he is doing. Not good for beginers.
Example: [Clancy's best fictional work] This novel represents the best of what Tom Clancy has to offer: exciting, fairly clever plot filled with intrigue and suspense. As with others of Clancy's early books, he leaves out female characters (which he is completely inept at portraying in any event) and does a good job of getting us to root for Jack Ryan at the turn of every page. Very readable.
Example: [This book is all you need for SCWCD Exam.] If you are preparing for the SCWCD(J2EE 1.4) Exam, then this book is all you need. Note that this book teaches you more than what you need to know for the exam. And as always, you need to practice writing a lot of code yourself.Even though I didn't have much experience with J2EE, I scored 89% by reading this book and practicing a lot of code. Also, don't forget to visit javaranch.com before the exam.
Example: [It's not all perfect...] To me, this book teaches Visual Basic 6 in a friendly manner, but it lacks explanation in some areas. Even though, it still is able to teach programming farely well.Watch out! This book does contain flaws in code. I encourage you to buy a little reference book so you are able to point out and debug the wrong code.This book isn't a newbies dream come true, but it is a decently good Visual Basic 6 book.
Example: [Dreadful!] This must be the most overrated movie in cinema history. A depressed boring has-been actor meets a depressed boring unhappy young wife and they do unmemorable things in Japan. The screen chemistry between the main characters is about the same as between a brick and a bar of soap. Bill Murray acts like he is pumped with Thorazine.This is truly one of the dullest, worst movies that I have ever seen. I literally had to keep waking myself up to keep watching it.The Emperor truly has no clothes. Sofia Coppola should get a job as a manicurist in Long Island.
Example: [Norton Password Manager 2004] I recently purchased the cd-rom of Norton Password Manager 2004And it does exactly what is says it will do!!!!!!!!!!!
Example: [Great Book] This book brings out the major steps and who was responsible for them from the time of Hippocrates forward. It is interesting and contains a review at the end of each chapter. The best part is that it holds the kids' interest, it isn't just a dry book filled with information. We are enjoying this book in our homeschool this year. Though it is written from a Christian perspective and does bring forth information about the faith of the men/women involved, it is not overly religious. For people of the Christian faith, it points out how faith influenced the people who are discussed, but the history is sound, and provides a good background in those major developments of medical history whether or not you believe in Christianity.
Example: [Incredibly hard to clean] I love that this travel mug is airtight, keeps my tea piping hot and my cold drinks super cold for hours. It's also spill proof in the car and easy to drink while driving.However, as another reviewer mentioned, it's incredible hard to clean this mug. I used this mug at first for my coffee every morning and I always use half and half. I would rinse and wash it out every day like I normally do with travel mugs. After a month, I noticed a strange odor coming from the lid. Upon further inspection and cleaning, I too noticed that there was a lot of crud trapped in the lid mechanism. I ended up cleaning it with a combination of steaming hot tap water, q-tips, and dish detergent. It took me about a half an hour to get everything out. But who has the time to do this every day?Now I limit its use to plain tea and cold drinks. This is disappointing to me because this mug is pricey as far as travel mugs go.
Example: [This offer is a joke...I only gave it 1 star because they forced me to] This should be a zero star rating!If you are looking for the entire Final Four...you will not find it here.As a Kansas alum, fan, and native Kansan...this DVD bothers me greatly. I would guess that many fans will want the full national semi-final game just as much as the championship game, but you will not get it here. The KU vs. UNC game has random cuts in the action. I was lucky enough to see a replay before the national title game, but I would prefer to own that UNC stomping in its entirety.I just do not understand why the NCAA cannot get it right. The best DVD set I have purchased was the 2004 Red Sox set. I would happily pay extra to get all the Kansas tourney games, but I guess this is the best you can hope for this year. The sad thing is that the bare bones 1988 KU DVD that is two separate DVDs is even better than this one.
Example: [What did I just say?] This book has changed my life, it has given the spoken language new clarity from the eyes of the young. I now have control of how words are spoken, interperted and understood, before I always assumed my child understood what I meant. My children have responded very well to this easy to follow and understand guide. We have also been fortunate enough to be in therapy with Dr. Donovan for the past 1 1/2, as we live in St Petersburg, Fl. Read the book, absorb the book, implement the book and change your world and your childs.
Example: [The lucky one] Zac Efrom is all grown up ! This Is his best film , yet !!! , He can sing , he can dance & he can act , he's one of the few young actor's of this generation , I can see an Oscar , an Emmy , a Tony & a Grammy ( or Many of them in his future ) ZAC EFROM IS THE BEST !!!
Example: [Great looking solid wood - poster frame!] I had so much trouble finding a decent 11"X 17" frame. This fame is a solid quality frame, I plan to purchase other sizes in the future.
Example: [Cheesy and so painful to read] i had no idea this was an old book either. shame on either amazon or the publishers for not stating that somewhere. I was convinced Harlen Coben did not write it and forced myself to read the whole thing. The story is cheesy and the dialogue even cheesier. what a waste of time.
Example: [DON'T DO THE TWIST] Twister is a bad movie with a horrible horrible plot that adds up to nothing. It's about a couple of tornado chasers that fall in love. Ever so dumb plot. The only thing that makes me give this movie two whole stars is the special effects (although the movie deserves only one). Special effects are great in this movie. If your a no plot special effects freak (buff), then you would love this horrible movie Twister. Rated PG-13: for language, and scenes of tornado damage
Example: [Cute, but not practical] These old mechanical speedometers were fun and they still are fun, but that is about all.These are the right thing for a classic bike from the 1960's or 1970's that is being restored and needs some authentic repop after-market glitz.The length of the cable is fork-length specific, however. Too long or too short and they won't work. The cable is a mechanical metal stick that is driven by the wheel and turns inside the cable housing to drive the mechanical clock inside the speedometer. It needs a pretty straight shot from the front fork dropouts to the mounting on the handlebar.These old things were fun as kids. They didn't last very long then and they don't last very long now either from a functionality standpoint. If you want it for cool factor on an old bike, this is the thing, surely. However, if you really plan to use it, get yourself a modern electronic cyclocomputer.
Example: [Veer-Zaara] After first seeing the last half this on SBS (Australian Govt. Funded TV) late one evening I was amazed at how fun The Bollywood Genre was.Looked the film up on the Web and found out that it was one of the most successful Bollywood films ever.The story in itself lends itself to fall into the "Chick Flick" category. A story of forbidden love, and the sacrifices people are willing to make...Brilliantly put together film, by far my favorite scene is the Festival of Lodi, brilliant dance, costumes and song... you just can't help but smile and enjoy it!
Example: [hard] We have a colgate foam mattress for our oldest daughter that we got at buy buy baby, we love it. Then to save some money I found this one on amazon. And I'm really bummed out about it. Our one from buy buy baby is two sided, one side is for NB's then you flip it when the baby is 1 years old for a softer mattress. So when I ordered this one I thought it would be just like that. But its SO hard and its not double sided. We're using it for now, but I'm going to have to get something different our 4 month old just tosses all night in it, I feel like shes sleeping on concrete!
Example: [Disappointed] I was very disappointed in the Red Oster Toaster Oven. When I put it on my counter, with the cabinets above, it did not look at all red; it looked black. The cord touched the back a little and it got really hot, and put out a smell that lasted one hour after it was unplugged, before it went away. The toaster has no setting so you have to just guess. I sent it back for a refund.
Example: [Better than Thought] You know I remember seeing the previews on tv for the movie and all I can think of is how that would probably one of the DUMBEST movies I have ever seen made. Once I saw it, my mouth stays shut, but not during the movie. I was laughing the WHOLE time! It was very amusing. It was worth watching it. And, I would watch it again.
Example: [Better Than Average] I loved the whole "ghost" story approach. Muffled crying in the night when no one is there. The mist. The cliff. The ghostly appearances. One would never guess until the end what is going on! The only problem I had was a 40 year old man pursuing a 20 year old girl. Call me old fashioned! But, you won't be dissappointed with this one. Although there are some "dead" scenes now and again (pardon the pun), all in all, a keeper.
Example: [No sophomore slump here] Side 1 - RockFunk #49- funky greasey rockAsshton Park- Echoplex demonstrationWoman- Good basslineBomber: Closet Queen/Bolero/Cast Your Fate-My copy is missing "bolero", but it's still A+Side 2 - Perfect head musicTend My Garden- Ode for those who were growing your own?The acoustic suite parts 1-31. There I Go Again-2. Thanks3. Ashes the Rain and I
Example: [THE OZZMAN DID IT AGAIN] Put the best songs ozzy has ever made alone together, add some black sabbath and you'll get one of the best osbourne cds EVER CREATED
Example: [Best TV series EVER] Season 1, 2, 3, WHERE'S 4, 5, 6, 7? In my opinion THE BEST TV SERIES EVER. TERRIFIC CHARACTERS and great plots. Love stories, adventure, and SCIFI. Like they were my family and this was my hometown, and I'M AN OLD GEEZER. Really amazes me what programs are retained for years and this was let go after 3. It should have been promoted more as most people never heard of it.
Example: [The new Garmn Quest Suction Cup holder is awesome] The new Garmin Quest Suction Cup holder is awesome. I have now the flexibility to put it everywere not possible with the old one. Definitely it is worth every penny. I highly recommend this device.
Example: [Excellent and from the Boris Karloff era] This movie brings back the scarry movie themes from the past. The mummy is a creature of passion and horror and the supernatural that we all wish we will not run into. We need to believe in something supernatural and the mummy captures todays tenology and yesterdays myths. Forget all your preconceived ideas and enjoy the movie.
Example: [If you need something to inspire the holiday spirit ...] If you need something to inspire the spirit of the holiday in your soul,this is the only CD you need to even think about!! Celine Dion captures the magic and the mystery of Christmas as only she can! Her version of Ava Maria is absolutely phenomenal! Who else would consider Brahm's lullaby on a Christmas CD? What a terrific gift she has given all of us!
Example: [Don't Waste Your Money!] Don't bother buying this! I bought it yesterday and it does NOT work. You have to bang the wheels into walls or furniture (rather HARD) for the music to play. It's supposed to go as baby walks or spins the middle circle. Nope. Another disappointment from fisher-price. It's too light - our 8 month old daughter tried walking with it and it went too quickly for her and she fell. Bad design.
Example: [Lovely Earrings] These earrings were exactly as represented. They look lovely on and I have received many favorable comments.
Example: [Excellent] I have read all but the last 2 books in this series (and those are sitting on my shelf), and ever single entry is excellent and intelligently written. Cuddy is honorable, tough and smart (although a bit too sanctimonious) and the other characters are always vivid and believable. The mystery here is first-rate; I was shaking my head in amazement after all the pieces came together. Healy deserves to be a lot better known and successful.
Example: [Bulldogs - This is for you!] I don't normally leave feedback but was so pleased with this product I decided to share it with other short haired dog owners. I have an American Bulldog who SHEDS EVERYWHERE. He shakes, fur flies! He loves this comb when I brush him outside, it left a pile of hair on the sidewalk. His coat is even shinier. The only problem I have now is that when it is time to go outside, he stares at the comb (I keep it by the door), so I'm obligated to brush him very often! Seriously, though, it cuts WAY down on the shedding hair.
Example: [Belkin Pre-N Desktop Card Review] Works very well with the Belkin router. Signal strength is far better than my previous Linksys router as well (router is on top floor of house and desktop is in the basement). As with previous posts, disregard the instructions to install with the label face-up. They are wrong - it goes in face down.
Example: [This vacuum sucks...dirt!] This vacuum is wonderful! I had another, smaller "pet" brand vacuum that promised to suck up all of the pet hair I had. Well after having it for less than a year it broke, and I began my search for a vacuum that actually worked that didn't break my bank. The price of this vacuum is what caught my eye first. It was around $50 which was in my price range for a vacuum. I got it home and it was very easy to put together. I was so surprised when I turned it on and vacuumed a small area in my bedroom! So much dust, and pet fur that I hadn't seen. I was able to go over that spot a few more times and pick up even more. This bissell has a powerful suck that gets ingrained dirt out. I also like the attachable parts that comes with this vacuum. I have been able to use those on my couch to pick up extra pet fur, and in the nook and crannies of the house. It is a bit noisey and can get pretty dusty but on the whole this a great vacuum for the price!
Example: [Don't waste an hour and a half of your life.] This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. You'll spend the entire movie asking what the heck the characters are doing, both because their actions make no sense and also since you will have figured out the plot sequence ages in advance. That extends to the conclusion, as well. Needless and obvious detours are taken in what I guess is an attempt to make this longer than the 30 minutes the story may deserve. The camera bounces from one angle to the next, serving to both confuse and distract from the already sucktacular scenes. Trust me, you'll walk away disgusted in the fact that you can't get the time you spent watching this movie back.
Example: [FALSE TEACHER] Do NOT waste your money on ANYTHING this author has written. He is not a Believer, He is not Jewish, He is not Christian, He is not even a good liar.
Example: [If I Never Knew You] Very disappointed they once again cut "If I Never Knew You." Who cares that it's included in the supplements! The fact that it's not in the actual film is so frustrating and ridiculous. Why are the people at Disney so clueless???
Example: [It's a rip off] It came, but is teeny tiny little cheap thing. Don't waste your money on this. Hardly even a stocking stuffer.
Example: [must have for lavender lovers] The best lavender cookbook around. They shipped fast and the condition was first rate. A must have for cooks.
Example: [Not worth the money] You get what you pay for. I bought them because they were less expensive than I have seen them elsewhere. I didn't take them out of the box for a few months and found that there was paint missing and one of the legs to hold it in place was missing. I kept them since they were going in the very back of my yard where hardly anyone would see them
Example: [great fun] This is a world gone by but fun to read the mystery. I did figure it out quite early, though. Well written and the characters are fun. He really is a fun writer to read.
Example: [Great at first, but has problems with chipping] We got these mugs for everyday use around the house (we're trying to reduce the amount of plastic our children drink from) but within a few weeks of regular use, the enamel started chipping off. We ended up having to throw them all away.
Example: [The worst] Don't believe the hype surrounding these bottles. Everyone told us that these were the best, etc.... Well, they're not. They leak everywhere (despite using the fix outlined on the package) and their low flow nipples only work if you have an hour to spare for each feed. We have had much better luck with the basic nipple/bottle set ups from Gerber or Playtex.
Example: [Doesn't work with Vista, however plug and play in Linux (Fedora 9).] I could never get the Vista driver to install properly. The one on the CD didn't work, the one on their website didn't either. The Realtek driver that installed itself automatically made my machine unstable. I called tech support and the lady hardly paid attention to my problem, and instead read from an annoying script as is what appears now standard for outsourced tech support.On the other side, even though Trendnet doesn't support Linux, it was plug and play and worked as expected in Fedora 9. So the open source Linux guys *without pay* made a better driver than Trendnet "engineers"? Unbelievable, I don't think I'd ever buy another Trendnet product.So if you're planning on using it in Vista, steer clear. However for other OSes it may work. Since I bought it to use in a Vista box, this one goes back to the store.
Example: [Absolutely no sense] I wouldn't listen to the other reviews. Coming from a student who's done very well so far in all his other engineering courses, nothing in this book makes any sense at all. They jump into topics you've never even heard of, and expect you to know everything right off the bat. There aren't many examples, most of it's derivation, and the book takes a tone that you are a genious and will understand everything without a concrete explanation. I wouldn't get this if its not a required text, if I were you.
Example: [A boring disappointment] I read Shield of Three Lions and Banners of Gold in 1988. I know the year, because my daughter had just been born. To wait so long for a sequel and have it turn out like this!There is no adventure, no romance, no fun. It's mostly a big bore about the Magna Carta. We never get to see the big romantic reconciliation we wait for.If you read the first two books, you are better off writing your own ending. I feel that Ms. Kaufman's heart just wasn't in this one. Sorry kiddo! But I will still read any new books you write.
Example: [A Beginning Book good to learn from and have as a reference] This is one of two books written at about a high school reading level that I like that will show a beginner the piece movements, rules and simple strategies (like controlling the centre in the openings). The other book is more text bookish, Learn Chess (author is Alexander) with better instruction but not so full of colour and illustrations. I also like the Juniors Chess for Beginners that is at my reading level and very complete. I first learn chess in England, then have been playing in some chess tournaments that are scholastic.A very good point is that this book is full of colour and the illustrations are very good. Nice to leave on the table top in the living room, and not to be stuck in the boot when driving! Enjoy!
Example: [Beware the flat tube!] Purchased this TV and returned it after a week. Couldn't stand the picture anymore. Overall picture was okay, but the flat tube apparently has problems. Scrolling tickers across the bottom of the screen appear to be waving in the breeze. I looked at other flat tubes when I returned it, and saw 3 more on display with the same problem. Any horizontal graphic looks curved, bowed, or slanted -- anything but straight and level. Also, very difficult to get accurate colors on this TV. Much better off to spend a little more for an LCD.
Example: [A disappointing read........] I was quite disappointed in this point as I though it was going to go more in depth as to "why and how" companies are marketing to the masses AND classes. Instead, what I got was a lot of repetition about how each luxury buying group the writer has created chooses to spend their money. This is stated very early on in the book and repeated without any new data several times thoughout, which gets tiresome quickly. There are charts and graphs to back up this same data but even they are repeated multiple times. Skip this one if you are looking for more substance.
Example: [The all time jazz classic with great remastered sound!!!] I'll keep this short and sweet,this is an all time jazz classic,hands down!!! This awesome reissue features incredible remastered sound,a treat to listen to!!! A must for any serious music collection!!! Recommended!!! Timeless!!! A+
Example: [Shark Attack 2] In order to like this movie, you have to really enjoy shark movies. My son is fasinated with sharks.
Example: [In need of an editor] One star may be a little low, but I get the feeling the other reviews came from the author's relatives. Since I bought the book based on the five star rating, I feel the need to balance them out.First off, the book has an appeal. If you've ever been in high pressure sales- insurance, auto, etc.- you'll love the way this author captures the pressure of these jobs. The first of the novel is great in this regard and the story itself has a good premise.But I was unable to finish the book because of the writing itself. I get the feeling that the book was vanity published by a rich business man. The writing itself gets very redundant and is shot through with cliches. It also occasionaly switches from active to passive tense. In some books this works. In this case it pulled me out of the story.As much as I respect the author for doing it on his own, I must say that he should've sprung for a good editor as well as the publishing.
Example: [Excellent account of victimology in Black culture...] This is a well written account of how ingrained victimology is in contemporary black culture. It also demonstrates almost painfully how important it is for so-called black leaders to stop perpetuating racism by making everything into a black/white issue. I learned so much from this book!
Example: [Great concept, horrible design] We bought this for my 4 yr old for Christmas, because he love rollercoasters. There are not a lot of rollercoaster toys out there especially for his age. He was so excited to get it. I spent about 30 min putting this together. The pieces kept popping off. If one piece doesn't work the whole thing doesn't work! Also, the roller coaster track did not touch the ground at the end of putting it all together. I seemed like the track was not long enough. I got frustraed with the ferris wheel popping off the sides and decided to return in! We got two other rollercoaster sets recently that my 4 yr old loves and they work for about the same amount! Although it will be many years before he can put them together.
Example: [An exquisite piece of work] Nanni Moretti's quirky look at life is funny and deeply touching at the same time. I could watch this film many times before tiring of it. If you're a fan of deeply intelligent, unpretentious film making, this video is a must.
Example: [Rendevous Lounge, Vol 2 - Mark Gorbulew] This is a very disappointing CD. Unfortunately, everything sounds the same to me with the exception of Gypsy Woman by Montefiore Cocktail. I regret that I purchased it and play it very seldom due to the repetitious sounding music.
Example: [A must read!!] This is one of those books that make the reader wince and almost feel like a voyeur. But it is also an important book for all people interested in why people choose to live a lie, or live a life devoid of concern for the other gender as well as innocent children.It's an excellent book as far as a wake up call for those who wonder why a certain segment of our society seems to be floundering and destroying itself.I also suggest that this isn't a black issue, but one that crosses ALL racial groups, since I have heard for decades that Latino men live similar choices sexually.As a woman it is a book that ALL women should read a be forewarned about.Knowledge in power!
Example: [Entertaining light read] Fairly predictable, but the likeable characters are entertaining . I plan to pick up book two, even though I think it's fairly predictable who the next couple will be.
Example: [Great for the college bound kid, and for fast no oil popcorn.] I have had this item for around 10 years now, and It still works great when I want popcorn quick. No oil, so it's light and fluffy. Its a great alternative to my air popper, which i love, but hate the noise at times. This was great when I had it for my dorm room, saved buying microwave popcorn with all that oil, smell and disgustingly greasy bags. I could control what I put on it. Must have for the college kid.
Example: [Finally a Bible Translation that is not defamed by man!] If you are a seeker of "God's Truths" this New Testament Translation is for you. The church has moved away from understanding God's plan of salvation by wrongful and misleading bible translations, by human error and by political pressure of the time of the translation so that God's Truth is no longer clear in today's translations. I highly recommend anyone seeking to know God's Truth they pray about ordering this bible translation. Seek the Truth and the Truth shall set you Free.
Example: [Read with Care] This book may be of interest to residents of the anthracite region of Pennsylvania and those interested in the Molly Maguires and the history of Irish immigration in general. However, it is necessary to take the book with a large grain of salt. It suffers for want of professional editing, and there are many factual errors. For general historical background on the history of the Molly Maguires, there are better sources available.
Example: [cha cha slide] my son loves this song, and when I finally found it, I was so happy. He can now hear it whenever he wants at home. The cd has about 5 versions of the song, so you can hear it all different ways.
Example: [Wouldn't play] This CD would not play. I tried several different CD players, including my computer, and all the songs skip. Maybe it's pirated???? Don't waste your money - go to a music store.
Example: [Essential Subjects] While many of the chapters contain information that will never change this 20-year-old edition is very outdated for anyone who may be or planning on eing a Marine. There are more recent issues of the guidebook that should be offered as replacements for this antiquated issue.
Example: [Quiet, good power, good value.] I picked up my HF810 at one of the local Amazon assocites to replace an old box fan that had just given up the ghost. What a difference! This fan moves much more air with a fraction of the noise. The adjustible floor stand makes it easy to aim the fan without leaning it up against a chair or some other precarious pose. Pointed upward, it moves air as well as a ceiling fan.It's not perfect, but for the money it's a very good value. I plan on buying a second one soon.
Example: [An acorn fell on the Disney Corporation!] In one word "BAD." Disney calls this talent? It doesn't get much worse than this. No talent and not even close to the original story. I guess if you come from the computer generation of cold creation and you have been starved for real motion picture entertainment and you have a brain cell of a "nat" then you might enjoy this film. Be safe and buy your kid a real Disney movie meaning before Walt died and before Eisner took over. Disney has lost all of their true talent. All i can say is poor Walt......
Example: [soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo cute!] I got Bratz Babyz hair flair Sasha yestarday. It was my dead grandfathers birthday and as we do every year, me and my brother open presents and spend time with our aunts. She was a christmas present from my grandma.I made a tissue pajama dress for her and she looks cute. She comes with a hair barrete, a hair brush, a baby bottle, a blue/white oufit in 2 pieces,and a tiara. she has black hair in two pigtails with a bunch of little tiny braids, black skin with gorgeous brown eyes, and her fingers and toes are painted. i made a tissue box house for my hair flair babyz and all the other babyz(yasmin,cloe,dana,kiani, and roxxi) welcomed her. i love her so much and persuade you to buy her.
Example: [pleez!!!!!!!!!!] this cracks me up everytime i hear (or see it) he tries so hard to be michael jackson, but his so-called voice is way lower so when he sings all high it sounds like he's sqealing.As for the song itself it is a beatless,rhythmless,generic piece of ... which most people will call "a brilliant piece of pop".my.... More like a brilliant flop.
Example: [The Heritage Press Edition...] The Heritage Edition of 1974 is a large format hardback with bold type and ample margins. Black slipcase.Bound in a glossy red-orange, it is illustrated with 8 gravures by Mara McAfee and has an introduction by Ashley Montagu.Sewn binding; 237 pp.
Example: [Vaguely Interesting Mis-Fire From Usually Consistent Band] George Martin's pristine production saves this disappointing follow-up to the classic "Revolver." Song content consists of embarrasing odes to travelling shows, imaginary bands, and psychedelic songs about plants and nature, all with negligable emotional resonance. Band quickly saw this artistic path as a dead end and headed for more rewarding territory on "The White Album." Still beloved by a minority for some obscure nostalgic appeal, it's lasting influence is only visible in such minor performers as Lenny Kravitz and Klaatu.
Example: [Good story in the classic romance tradition.] Quite entertaining ...a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r
Example: [Atlas Shrugged Book Review] Wow, it is amazing how prophetic some of the content of this book is. It is timeless and a great novel, thanks.
Example: [Does not work with Blu Ray player] I bought two differet Living Landscapes HD blu ray movies and neither works in a blu ray player. Working on returning them.
Example: [Even if you don't cook/bake this is worth the money] Hello everyone, I have owned mine for about two years. To start with I didn't do much baking but when i did ( making Brownies or cakes) this was worth having and the money. Clean up is as easy as running hot water over it. Recently I have started baking breads and I have heard taht this model wasn't good for mixing dough. I have to totatlly disagree. This thing will need a 1.5 to 3 lb loaf from 5-30 minutes with easy. I am now making bread loafs from rustic, bagguettes, sourdoughs, and others, two to three times a week because of the ease of this machine. What use to take 30 minutes of hand kneading now takes 6 minutes on high spead to make perfect ciabatta bread.
Example: [PAPER JAMMED] AMAZON SHOULD NOT HAVE SOLD THIS MP530 PRINTER. AFTER PRINTING A FEW PAGES, THE ALARM LIGHT COMES ON AND IT STATES " PAPER JAMMED." TO DO MORE PRINTING YOU HAVE TO REMOVE THE PAPER, RAISE THE SECTION WHERE YOU CAN SEE THE INK JETS THEN LOWER,AND THEN PUSH THE " OK " BUTTON. FROM THEN ON YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW THIS PROCESS FOR EACH SHEET PRINTED. THE FIRST 2 WEEKS, I JUST UNPLUGGED THE PRINTER AND USED MY WIFE'S PRINTER AND REPLUG THE NEXT DAY. MANY TIMES I THOUGHT I WOULD SEND IT BACK BUT WHY SPEND THE SHIPPING COST. CANON WILL SELL A NEW PRINTER FOR JUST A LITTLE MORE THAN I PAID FOR THIS WORN OUT MACHINE; HOWEVER MY INK JETS COULD NOT BE USED IN THEIR NEW PRINTERS.
Example: [A yes, B no.] The .a half of this thing works just fine. I have an Netgear HE102 (.a only AP) and it seems comparable in performance.However the .b side is completely worthless. WEP or not, Netgear, Toshiba and other client adapters, all the same. No range, instable connection. Tried latest firmware, nada. Tried a pair of the WAB102's with same results. Steer clear of this thing. Get the HE102, or something better if you need .a, and get a $... special out of the sunday paper for your .b/.g needs.
Example: [RIght on] Just as expected. It's big and it blows air... Hey, it's "Swiss"... what else needs to be said.
Example: [Yippie Ki Yea Mother F****r] Truly one of Bruce Willis' best performances of his career. I think that Die Hard is one of the best action movies of all time. Every Christmas Eve I sit down and watch Die Hard from beginning to end. And this past Christmas I noticed something, how old Bruce Willis looks. That is, in his recent films. In fact, I hardly could recognize him. Can't wait till Die Hard 4 comes out.
Example: [Great Book] A friend from my wednesday night church group recommended this book to me. Every man needs to read this book. We are going to start the small group study in a couple of weeks for Wild At Heart. I can't wait. Read this book!
Example: [size matters] If you have the same system as I do, you are expecting to receivetwo (2) 16 x 12 1/2 filters. This vendor, eventhough the stocknumber calls for two filters, sends you one 16 x 25 filter whichdoesn't fit.Be aware.
Example: [Illogical and slanted] This entire book is one big logical fallacy. It sets up the KJV as the rule and compares all the other translations to it. Of course the other translations are going to be different! And if the KJV is the rule, any change in another translation is automatically seen as inferior. Also, if you even know a little bit about Greek and English grammar, you would know that it is impossible to have a word for word translation let alone letter for letter. I love the King James Translation, but we must remember that is a translation. We cannot reject the manuscripts. The only thing AWE inspiring about this book is that its 1200 pages of fallacy.
Example: [Memory lane] All the cars I fondly remembered growing up. A few more pictures would have made this a 5 star book.
Example: [This man is a genius] I first experienced Tom's cooking at the Dahlia Lounge about 3 years ago, and I was completely blown away. Visit after visit, meal after meal, his dishes always suprise and amaze me. His imagination with regards to food is incredible. The menu changes constantly and I think it just keeps getting better. But this is a review of his book... All of the recipes that have made all three of his restaurants famous are here. The thing that suprised me is that he is completely open with his "trade secrets". He's like a magician that can't wait to explain to you how to perform his trick, because he loves the magic that much: he wants everyone to be able to do it. And all the recipes work, too! I've made about 20 different thing from this book, and not one of them hasn't turned out perfectly. His style of writing is very accessable. And for the seattle resident, there is the bonus of a complete list of where to find all the best ingredients. A priceless book.
Example: [Talkity talk talk] This book starts with a good premise, but soon succumbs. This book has two main problems.1. Too little happens. If you look this book honestly, you soon regognize, that very little happens. which leads question what is done with all those pages? and problem two.2. Talk Talk Talk, oh boy do they like to talk. And go over same things again and again and again. And don't get me started with the cartridge case episode at the first half of the book.So to but it bluntly, this book is Boring. It was my first book from Griffin and my last.
Example: [pyle 7" rear vision monitor and camera] I have bought hundreds of things from Amazon and have been very satisfied. This item is the exception. It simply does not work well inbright daylight or at night. The lights never lit for night. It is my 2011 worse buy.
Example: [This is very very badly done............] I cannot beleive that this was made by Masterpice Theater,(who in my opion Love, and they have not dissapointment till now). Its a disgrace to Jane Austen and Fans everywhere as was the 1999 version, where do these people get thinking they can change a perfectly good story? I have read the book three times and dont understand why they must make a movie in "fast forward" mode. And another thing that just gets my goat is Fanny's Uncle is made to be a most horrible man , when in truth was a wonderful Uncle and Fanny was one of his favorites, He loved and repected her more than he did his wife and daughters, come on people get a clue and dont mess with good if you cant make it better or follow with what a billian Author made. I'm so sorry to make this so harsh but I just got it in today and cannot beleive i spent money on it.
Example: [both pair were damaged, Seller NEVER responded to emails] Both pair of cheap glasses arrived bent, one pair were too bent to use, the second pair were slightly bent but usable. For this cheap price, we did not expect high quality glasses, and we got what we expected, they were cheap quality but would have been sufficient, had they not been bent.We sent many emails to the seller, the seller NEVER, NOT ONCE, responded to our emails.I gave a two star instead of a one star for the following reasons: Cheap price equals low risk, if the glasses are wearable, it is worth the price (one pair of ours was only slightly bent and wearable--since the price was so low, the one pair was worth it)--but it was disappointing that the second pair was unwearable, and that the seller did not deem it worth their time to answer an email.
Example: [Don't last] I've used several brands of rechargeable batteries through the years (Monster, Radioshack, rayovac, etc.). They're all still working (recharge and hold their charge). The newer duracells rechargeable batteries are all DEAD (won't recharge to more than .6V). Could it be that duracell purposefully makes really crappy rechargeables to sell more regular batteries? Surely not!? or? Note: This review applies to Duracell Rechargeable AA NiMH 2650mAh AND 2500mAh batteries (strangely the Duracell AAA seem fine).
Example: [worse one of her series] Just one word of it "terrible"!!! I've read all her FBI/Mystery series and this is by far the worst. The story is all over the place and the characters are never really developed. It was very painful reading this one...really bad! One thing I'm finding with Catherine Coulter is a hit or miss with her books. The Maze was great and after reading The Edge, you will have a hard time believing it's the same writer.
Example: [Shark Vac] Was very disappointed on how cheaply made it was. I have bought several and this one is by far a lower quality that is available.
Example: [Infecting summer 2003 with JOY.] While to me, it's disappointing to see Sugar Ray has strayed from they're solid rock sound from the self titled album (which I give 5 stars), In the Pursuit of Leisure is a collection of songs that fit right in with everything summer is about. Grooving to these tunes isn't hard to do... aside from the first single Mr. Bartender (which is to me just a dance song that'll make you tap your feet), this album is filled with songs you almost feel guilty for enjoying for a second or tird listen. Regardless of the fact that this CD to me is a step below what the self titled cd had to offer, it's hard not to like songs like the one's found here. I reccomend this Sugar Ray offering to anyone looking for a smile.
Example: [Overall, a good read] George reprises her strong characterization and plot lines in this book. The ending is particularly satisfying, suspenseful, and believable. I especially enjoyed the continuing developments between Havers and Lynley. The one drawback: the chapters alternate between narrative and a first-person viewpoint from a major character. It's harder to follow than some of George's previous work, but worth the effort.
Example: [Message is clear without understanding the words] The viewer has a bird's eye view of the simple life in a family in Mongolia. They are a tight unit and support each other in all their daily activities. The weeping camel stands out when she finally accepts her little offspring and it is touching to realize that so many of the human race are dying from the lack of love and affection. This really touched my heart.
Example: [Best phone i have ever owned] This phone is amazing. What people are going to have to understand is that there will be and always will be problems or features the service provider has or the phone has...some of these are planned by the companies themselves...so you will buy another phone(a more expensive one)...ex. LG L1400 doesnt have speakerphone but the V551 does and the V551 doesnt have the second screen but the L1400 does....its all up to preference and the people who put these phones down should have looked at the features before they start purchasing expensive phonesIf you like what you see in the description and the feature menu for this phone it is WELL worth the investment and so is the V551. These are two very exceptional phones and I recommend both of them. I however chose the LG phone simply b/c I wanted the second screen ( I did alittle homework...hm what do ya know.)Oh and if you ever need a flashlight open the L1400 its pretty bright.
Example: [Rocamojo] Best price on internet and it qualifies for supersavings shipping from amazon. Would recommend that everyone buy thru amazon as we have had a bad experience with other merchants carrying this product. It is a great coffee substitute...tastes great.
Example: [Don't waste your time] I absolutely loved "Secret Life of Bees", so I couldn't wait to read another of Sue Monk Kidd. However, "The Mermaid Chair" is quite possibly the worst book I have ever read! First of all, the plot is incredibly close to "Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood." Could she not think of anything on her own? Second, the supposed "plot twist" was nothing more than a mere paragraph of nonsense that left me extremely disappointed. Finally, as this book is supposed to be powerful to women; however, it leaves the reader with the idea that you need a man to be complete. I can't believe I actually finished it! Such a disappointment.
Example: [Seems like fun] We receive this as a baby shower gift. It seems like fun with the cute characters and prints. It was able to keep my baby entertained for about 20 - 30 minutes each time. Those butterflies are useless. The description says "butterflies spin at baby's touch"; but, it's way too high for young babies to reach. It would be better if the manufacture had put a motor in it.
Example: [Wow] Seriously... I opened this after over 12 hours and my coffee was still steaming. I was shocked! I mean you had to look for the steam, it wasn't obvious, but I don't care, after 12 hours if it's even still warm I'm impressed.
Example: [Good price!] What can you say about filters? It keeps out the cat hair. Works as it should.This is the best price I could find.
Example: [Eleventh Tiger] A very good first Doctor novel set in 1865 Japan. The Doctor lands right in the middle of an English foray into Japan with Ian mysteriously recognised and attacked by one of the locals. They spend time in a Japanese medical facility and it finishes where it started in caves. Just the right amount of science fiction and historical fact mixed together very well.
Example: [Wonderful Seller] This movie was delivered to me before I expected to have it and in perfect condition. Brand new. I would highly recommend purchasing from this seller and plan to do so myself in the future.
Example: [Offers consistently 5-star recipes] This cookbook is excellent. I often check out cookbooks from the library and it is hard to find ones that offer recipes that are consistently 5-star. After making about ten recipes and only disliking one, I went ahead and purchased this gem. It contains a little of everything, from your standard pesto to truffles to instructions on how to spatch-cock a Cornish hen. The additional instructions, explanations and history lessons are invaluable in helping out with the planning process that goes into making a meal. And to boot this book can be had for only $10.00.
Example: [THIS IS NOT A WORKOUT DVD*!!] If you have absolutely NO knowledge on how to hit a heavy bag than you shouldn't even be using one. This brief dvd will NOT educate you on the proper way to hit a bag. Just different combinations that even the most clueless to this sport would know.. The jab cross combos ETC. It does not provide you with even ONE ten minute work-out routine. It's just one hour of this man talking, basically. To return it isnt even worth the money I would get back after I paid for shipping.I give it 2 stars only because it educated you on how to adjust your speed-bag platforms and make changes so you can have the proper rhyme.. IE. adding a wood panel the same circumferance on top of the platform and drilling through.. I suggest you keep looking.
Example: [Super collection] Very pleased to have all of these wonderful Dr. Seuss cartoons on one DVD! Great collection of some old favorites! The kids and I will enjoy this one for years to come.
Example: [What were they thinking?] OK... I'll give them this: the scenery with the temples and such was nice to look at, but the script was awful, the acting was awful, and the whole thing just ...stank. I asked Blockbuster for my money back.Six of us watched the movie and we all were left dumbfounded that anybody even funded this boondoggle. I think my dog could write a better script.If I could possibly give this movie "0" stars, I would.
Example: [Good Concept, but...] The idea seems good, but when you are in the shower, the tablet needs to be directly under the water. This does not allow you to receive much of the water. Also, the vapors tend to bypass the nostrils and goes straight to the eyes, which causes slight tearing and a burning sensation. Lastly the tablet heats up and you can't touch it at all, which also keeps you away from the water. Sorry that I can't give this product a higher rating, it has too many flaws.God bless!
Example: [Great Cutting Board For the Money!] This is a great cutting board for the money. Its well made and is working out great! My wife just loves it! I gave it to her as a early Christmas gift. We have had it 3 1/2 weeks now and it has not discolored or warpped its still looks like new and it has been used daily so far so good as of 12/20/2008
Example: [Verry usefull German grammar learning tool] This was a very useful reference tool while learning German. Shipment and delivery was prompt.
Example: [EJD is probably the best out there.] I won't give a synopsis or anything like that but I really enjoyed this book. This is another book of his that I almost hated reading because I don't want it to end. I hope he puts out two books a year from now on. He also doesn't pander to the women like most black authors tend to do. They forget that men read too.I bought this book on Monday and my wife and I are both done reading it and today is Thursday.EJD keep doing what you doing, the men like reading your stuff too.
Example: [Broken Upon Delivery] I've needed this kind of light in my apartment for a while now. However, when I was assembling the light, I discovered that the head was not properly screwed on. It cannot be repaired easily; the parts in the head are weirdly assembled and not simple to take apart. Also, the dimmer knob is wobbly and not tight.Basically, if I don't touch it, and it just stands there, it's fine. If I bump it, or turn it on or off, it's pretty unstable.
Example: [Great Insight] This book is written for men but should be read by every wife or wife to be - even young Christian women who are dating. It truly gives an insight into what may be on a man's heart or what may have wounded his heart. This insight can be invaluable to the strength of the relationship and the understanding of the wife's role in the man's life. This could result in a more meaningful and deeper marriage relationship!
Example: [To tell the truth?] When brother and sister are playing soccer in the house they end up breaking mama's favorite lamp! They try making up a lie to get of of the blame. But can they keep their story straight>?This book teaches kids how it is better to tell the truth and not to lie no matter what they have done. It is a great lesson to me learned and I suggest it for any child!
Example: [Interesting and Imaginative] I found W.T. Smith's film to be an innovative and imaginative response to the work of Manzarek and McClure. He managed to bring a genuinely cinematic sensibility to a subject that does not, on the surface, suggest such a response. I recommend this documentary to anyone who is interested in the beats or performance poetry.
Example: [I HAVE BEEN RIPPED OFF!!!] I bought hylexin from 101BeautyStore. Before purchasing it I emailed him and asked the expiration date and if the item was original. I received an email back claiming that the item is fresh and genuine. Everything has gone normal until the use of 1/3 of the cream. After 1/3 has been used another 1/3 was full of liquid inside. The expiration date was good but the originality of the item is a big question mark???? By the way the good effect of the eye cream is far away then the ones I used before. The item is not original and genuine. DON'T BUY FROM HIM!!!!
Example: [Trial and error experience combined with knowledge] Defining Your Own Success: Breastfeeding After Beast Reduction Surgery is specifically written to enable mothers who have had breast reduction surgery to breastfeed their babies. Though breastfeeding after such surgery is generally thought impossible, recent advances in breast reduction surgical techniques now allow lactation capabilities to be better retained than in the past. Trial and error experience combined with knowledge has allowed thousands of post-surgical women to breastfeed in spite of the obstacles. Defining Your Own Success explicitly describes how to maximize a woman's milk supply and confront challenges. A special section is also devoted specifically to the professional perspective, from health care providers to plastic surgeons and maternity nurses. Personal anecdotes and several appendices round out this well thought-out reference. Highly recommended.
Example: [Noz a must see!] junk!!n junk jink!! terrible unfuuny movi thaz waz ruining by Chirs tucker. when will thisz guy become funny?? will thatz day ever happen??!! he just kept on talking TRYING to make a joke after joke. chan wasn't thT GREAT EITHER. really bad movie that i'm suprisedz to knowz people will like.n it just proves anything canz getz made today, and someone will always like it. pure junk......word out!
Example: [Ouch] Well, I'm a Pagan and I did not like this book. It was written at a time when the Christians were starting on a major campaign to slaughter Pagans and bring us into the Dark Ages. But rather than say all the things I disliked about it, I'll just let anyone who wants to know what I think of it e-mail me.
Example: [Love Comes Softly Series] I love this entire series and have followed it since Love Comes Softly came out a couple of years ago. Can't wait to see the 7th in the series tonight, Love Takes Wings and the next which will be April 11 I think and has Patty Duke in it. Although the movies don't follow the books exactly and some of the characters are different, it's still a great series and one that I'll watch over and over again. Michael Landon, Jr. is great!
Example: [microsuede feather king comforter set chocolate] I PURCHASED THIS ITEM AS A WEDDING GIFT ASSURED THAT SINCE I BOUGHT IT FROM AMAZON THE PARTY I GAVE I TO WOULD NOT HAVE ANY PROBLEMS. NEVERTHELESS AND UNFORTUNATELY,AFTER THEY USED IT FOR ABOUT 5 DAYS, THE FEATHERS STARTED TO SHED, AND THEY HAD TO BUY A DUVET TO COVER IT, THIS EMBARRASSED ME.I SUGGEST THAT AMAZON CHECK THE MERCHANDISE BEFORE SENDING IT TO THEIR CUSTOMERS.THANK YOUYOLANDA ROVIROSA
Example: [Good not great] I enjoyed this movie for a one time watch. The story was engaging enough to keep me interested and it had enough action to keep me watching. I don't regret renting it but would never watch it again.
Example: [SBC Helldiver in Action - Aircraft No. 54] The book was for my husband for a project (painting) he was working on. It helped him to answer a question he was pondering so it was a good purchase for him. He has many of these books in his library but did not have the one on the Helldiver. Thanks!
Example: [Very entertaining for kids (toddlers)] Frankly I don't know why this series is so sought-after by toddlers like my children, but perhaps it is a generational difference and perhaps I will never understand. However, it is obviously very much in demand and very entertaining for little kids. My daughter watches this almost every day. We have lots of Dora programs aside from this. I even had to order some Dora dolls. They must be doing some great marketing. Only thing I don't like is all the Spanish mixed with English, as it may confuse some young kids which is what and may end up mixing languages into Spanglish. Huge commercial success, obviously.
Example: [I must be really dim] I have tried and tried to read this book, and just cannot get into it, get it, be inspired by it, stay with it, have an "aha" moment--and I have given this book more chances than I've ever given any book. I am puzzled. Maybe I'm just dim. I don't get it.
Example: [colour drops out, frustrating response from Panasonic Australia] When it works, it's great. However each time I go on a research trip to Europe or N America (ie. costing me a lot of cash) an intermittent fault occurs where the image (in still mode or video)drops out the red range, so the recorded image has a blue cast. I am an art historian, so bringing back faulty data is not good for my research. And dealing with Panasonic Australia is a nightmare. Neither the shop, or the repairer, or the company will take final responsibility. I have sent it away twice, and today send it back for another test. Even when you provide them with the hard evidence of the fault, the camera comes back just as it was. Next stop the small claims tribunal...
Example: [Why so morbid?] Wonderfully written but generally morbid. I loved Stones and immediately again appreciated Hegi's incredible writing ability. Like Stones, the environment in which the stories take place is grey and depressing. Some of the stories are very uplifting but most are about horrible things that happen to regular people. The only reason the repetition of this type of story makes sense to me is that at a certain age these are the types of things kids focus on.
Example: [The best looking water kettle on the market.!] The first electric water kettle I owned was a Black and Decker and it died after 6 months. Since than I've owned a Krups, toastmaster, Kenwood, Russell Hobbs, and Philips and two Braun tea kettles(I liked the Braun so much I had to buy a second). Not only is the Braun the most beautiful but it and the Philips are the most functional of the groups and I use them several times a day. The Braun unit I have been using for about the last 4 years and it has never failed me and is still going strong. I look to many more years from this great appliance.
Example: [Dremel Planer] Feel Cheated!There are many websites that claim that the DREMEL XPR PLANER is compatible with many Dremel Multis . When I recieved the planer the box stated only for the 400 Model! When I contacted Dremel they said that although it might fit it is unsafe to use for only the 400 is fast enough! Most reviews of the 400 say that it's not worth the upgrade. The cost and bother of returning is not worth it. I am stuck with it.Don't buy unless you are planning to get the 400- it is probably included in most kits.
Example: [Good Watch with band issue] This watch originally had a plastic or resin band that broke frequently, every few months, and the replacement band is stainless. It works fine except for the dim night light feature. The band does not appear to fit as well as it should and thus pops off. The band and watch have a poor fit where the pin inserts to secure the band and watch together. Other than that, it works very well.Given all the posted complaints with the resin bands and pins failing on the stainless bands you have to wonder why Timex does not care to fix either issue. As much as I like the durability of the timepiece, that band problems make it hard to recommend. You should not have to buy a Rolex to get a watch that remains on your wrist.
Example: [Behind the Scenes with the Best] When Satriani heard that Jimi Hendrix had died, he quit his high school football team and took up guitar. This video unfolds tantalizing bits and pieces of this master's career. It spans history from the days when he taught guitar lessons for $5.00 each (Steve Vai, another master guitarist was one of his students) through the early 90's.The movie is made up of interviews with Satriani, his peers, and his producers, interspersed with concert footage and music videos. Comic relief is provided by "interview" footage with Spinal Tap's guitarist.If you like excellent guitar work, if you worship creativity and excellence, if you simply want to get some clue as to how Joe works his magic with his axe, you need to own this movie. If, on the other hand, your taste in guitar is more firmly grounded in Juaquin Rodriguez or the Romeros, you'll be rather disappointed with this incredible Blues/Rockfest.
Example: [cute but cheap] I generally write pretty enthusiastic reviews of things I buy on amazon but not here. The toy box is adorable, I'll grant you that. It holds a lot which is also nice. However, it is unbelievably cheaply made. The pre-drilled holes don't even remotely line up so I had to break out the drill and fix it myself. The wood is cheap and soft, scratches easily, and is poorly stained. It would be an acceptable product if it cost half the price they are selling it for but it's a rip off at the listed price.
Example: [Zzzzzzzzzzzzzz. Gag. Zzzzzzzzzzzzz.] Not funny. Disjointed. Boring. Pointless. Dumb. What a waste of money
Example: [Bad Disc's] I have been a fan of this show for years. I too bought each season as it came out. Three weeks ago I purchased the box set because I wanted the movies. Unfortunatly my set was very deffective. The very first disc would only play for the first 20 minutes and then stopped. Upon checking the rest of the disc's I found all but 2 had mild to moderate scratching. The packaging is terrible. I had to return my set.
Example: [fantastic!!!] coming from a non-reader, this book hooked me into reading. it is much better than the movie
Example: [PS2 Guitar Hero I -- great game!] This is a great game. My son and I played it in the store a month or so before Christmas and I was so happy that he put it on his wish list so that I would be able to play too! So he got it for Christmas and it was a hit with everyone. I think some of the songs are pretty difficult, but then I haven't played it very much. With 3 levels, there's a lot of room to improve your skills, and still be challenged. And then, there's Guitar Hero II! Definitely recommend!
Example: [No grass] We live in the Seattle area, I always have said if you can't grow a lawn here, then give up. Got this to fix up a couple spots, followed the directions, and nothing. I wouldn't get it again.
Example: [Brilliant!] I'm no classical buff, in fact I'm more into alternative stuff,but this CD is beautiful.If you ever wanted some classical work, and wantedsomething a bit off the beaten track, i.e.not the stuff you hear in adverts, this if for you.Checkout the samples...you'll end up playing it for years and years.I know I never get bored of it.
Example: [Pigman] The Pigman was a great book.At first when I heard about it,I thought it sounded dull.But It's not.It's one of the best books I've ever read!Everyone should read it.
Example: [Buttery Good] My son loves these you do not have to add extra butter-sometimes I add leftover chicken-quick & easy
Example: [need return the item] I bought this items on APR/28/2012 and it getting very and very noisy after 2 months. I need someone contact with me and return this item.
Example: [So Disappointed...poorly made] Received this as a gift from a catalog. I picked it out myself, thinking that, despite reviews, surely it will be better than our previous toaster oven that heated unevenly. When we received it, I was thrilled. The idea and functionality is a good one, but the execution is poor. The oven feature didn't work, we had to slam the slider over hard to get it to stay lit. Usually it just turns off automatically, not in a temperature control way, the heating elements just don't turn on at all. I finally called Hamilton Beach, and because we received it as a gift, and their warranty doesn't include shipping and handling, now I have to pay to have it shipped to me. Trust me, from a normally optimistic consumer, stay away. Look for a sturdier product with known quality control.
Example: [Just sad] Plot, writing, and dialog are rediculous. Both actors could do a much better job, but given the sillyness of the whole thing, did passibly well. Really silly b-movie horror ending. Yuck.
Example: [I really love these books!] I think these are a really great books! There're fun,interesting, and you never want to put them down. Julie is an awesome heroine. These books are a really good way to look at the way Eskimos live. I highly recommend them.
Example: [John Hiatt] Super adult, contemp. music.Heard a song during the movie, "RAISING HELEN"...researched it, foundit (THIS JOHN HIATT ALBUM)...didn't stop playing it for 3 days!!!!Loved every track on it. What a gem.Would highly recommend it, just for pure vocals and soothingdynamic. LOVED IT!
Example: [A wacky yet insightfull journey] Comics are more profound than you remember. They are an effective means to tell a narrative and in these pages you will feel emotions that you thought not possible within this medium. Be patient and yes, read the instrucctions before you begin.
Example: [Not bad at all!] Excellent cast. Interesting story line. And humor thrown in as well. The movie was actually fun to watch. For a nostalgic trip from years past, go for it. I believe you'll like it too.
Example: [Not trendy] I watched and did the program presented in this video for the first time yesterday and really enjoyed it. I read a lot of the reviews here and so many complain about the yoga being slow and easy. I think that if one really works in the poses and remains active in them then this is a great workout. If you do not have the patience or concentration for that, then buy Buns of Steel. Yoga requires patience. Plus Suzanne Deason was trained in Iyengar Yoga which is not all about violent movements and sweating and straining and...well maybe it is not trendy. But yoga should not be about that anyway.
Example: [Poor] If only I'd realized that this CD is Tony Christie re-recording his best songs in a trashy "Europop" style. It sounds like a CD of cheap covers, not much resemblance to the Tony Christie original versions that I remember. Stay away from this CD and buy "The Very Best of Tony Christie" instead (ASIN: B00000DB0C). Sorry Tony, but if it ain't broke don't fix it!
Example: [Not the best World's Finest book I've ever read.] First let me say that this is not a standalone book. If you don't know the history of Batman and Superman there will be places where you'll stop and go "huh?" I felt Mr. Kessel could have done a much better job referencing this history rather than just expecting the reader to know it. That said, I thought the book started off very well. The first four years (the book covers a ten year period) was well written and very enjoyable. The fifth year, which dealt with Mxyzptlk and Bat-Mite, was fun. Unfortunatly, the book goes down hill from there. I found the ending to be silly and completely unsatisfying. Which pretty well sums up the last half of the book.
Example: [GPS not reliable] When I first purchased this item, I loved it. There were a few times the GPS led me astray, but generally, it really helped me get from place to place in my job. It helped my find places where I did not know where they were, or helped my find short cuts from place to place. However, soon after I got it, it quit "acquiring satellites". It would try and try to find satellites (even though it showed them on one of the screens). Most often it would never find the satellites, or if it did, it was about the time I arrived at my location. The GPS had trouble no matter what location I was in, whether rural or city. I sent it in for repair, and from what I can tell of the paper I received when it was returned (which was very vague)to me, they replaced it. Unfortunatly, it is still doing the same thing. It is a great data management system, however, and I love that it interfaces with "Word". The GBS is a big disappointment. It's overpriced for what it can truly provide.
Example: [Great product] I've owned at least 6 similar products over the years but this one is the best yet. It is a bit more expensive than the others but truly makes up for it in quality and efficiency. Dirt and crumbs disappear off hard surfaces on the first pass. The product is extremely maneuverable, getting into corners and against base moulding with ease. Though not designed to be a primary tool for vacuuming carpets, it does a great job on the fir needles and grass caught by the throw-rugs inside our doors.
Example: [Will Ackerman's Best CD] Wow! Not since I first heard Passage, years ago, have I been so moved by one of Will Ackerman's CD's. (Passage was life changing.) He has gone back and allowed the essence of the music to emerge as a good port will develop only with the passage of time. Mature, slowed, and played with understanding, these are some of his best studio recordings.
Example: [Best! If you want to know what a verse means.....] This is one of the best works on exegesis. Not as heavy as "The Modern Preacher and the Ancient Text" but is a good pair with it. The five chapters dealing with interpreting Scripture, if followed exactly, should give the reader the exact meaning of the text of Scripture being studied. I have recomended this book to many--it is for all people who use the Bible. If you want to understand what a certain verse means, then this tool can get you there.Corrects many false views and assumptions one brings to the text of Scripture... if only all Christians would not follow the instructions here, exactly.
Example: [Arguably the best worship CD ever] Here we are, eleven years after this CD was released, and if I had to name the best worship album I have ever heard I would pick this one. To me, this is what Vineyard worship music is all about -- intimate, authentic, and meant to be entered into. I still listen to it once in a while and it still touches something inside and re-ignites that Hunger.
Example: [I very much enjoyed this book] Stabenow manages to capture perfectly the chaotic feel of Alaska life. I worked up there several summers and it felt like I was back in one of the frontier towns that I remember fondly. This is pretty far into the Shugak series, but a librarian recommended that I start with this book. I found that I did not need to read any of Stabenow's other books in order to fall in love with Shugak and the series. Since then I have pretty much read them all and I would say that none of them quite matches this one. So if you have not read any Shugak mysteries yet, this might be a good place to start.What's so unusal about this book while comparing it to both others in the series as well as other mysteries, is that it pretty much doesnt have a mystery. Instead what makes this such a fun read is that you are lead on an excursion into the life of the protagonist that is well worth following along upon.
Example: [Entry Level Arturo] Perez-Reverte is at his most accessable in this Iberian soaked tale of drugs, death and defiance. Typically, his female lead is gutsy, gritty, gorgeous and ruminates on the eternal 'whys' of fate, love, mercy and cruelty.The Queen of the South is tightly paced compared to many of Perez-Reverte's other novels and perhaps because of this the depth of nuance found in The Fencing Master or The Nautical Chart, is missing here. Still we cannot help but want more.Perez-Reverte writes with a touch that is personal to everyone and accessable to many. The Queen of the South may also be the best-translated of his novels. For those new to the genre, its a great entry point into the best Spanish-speaking literature we have today.
Example: [Loses what makes them so good] These remixes are a mixed bag, and overall, a disappointment to those like me who rate Bowery Electric at the height of their genre (much better than, say, Massive Attack) for their uncanny intuitive spot-on ability to find perfect real (almost hybrid sexual and meditative) grooves. Basically these tracks take those grooves and add on what really is so annoying about most others in the field, namely the typical pitfalls of drum and bass: loud artificial drum machines and casio-like atmospherics. Even the good tracks like "Empty Words" suffer.If you're a fan of the genre in general, this is nice double-cd to pick up. There are enough interesting moments and ideas and a few wonderful tracks to make the modest price well worth it. Would I put this on when I have company? Never. Definitely not in the same class as "Lushlife" or "Beat."
Example: [Skips!!!] I bought a few seasons, and I've made it through the fourth so far. Two or three of the episodes are completely unwatchable, because it skips so bad. Even though I bought it because the quality was "very good," the case was not in great condition and the disc was CLEARLY and VISIBLY damaged. Sure enough, when I try to play it, it skips!
Example: [A book for all ages] This book won the Newberry Honor book for a reason. In my opinion it should have been the Winner. This is a thougthful, well written book. It is full of great characters in a thought provoking story. Seeing the story of Malaga Island and the town of Phippsburg through the wise young eyes of Turner Buckminster was brilliant. Gary Schmidt is a master at telling the story of "adolescents turning their face toward adulthood." I heard Gary say those very words last week when I heard him speak at a local community dinner. I was very moved by all he talked about. It is clear that he is a gifted storyteller on paper and in voice. Lizzie Bright tells an important story about ignorance, prejudice and growing up. As an adult who loves to read well written juvenile fiction, I am looking forward to more great books by Gary Schmidt.
Example: [Mormonism - another view] It is a far too widespread trend in this country that all religions are supposedly created equal and that all lead to God/heaven. Thank God for this pamphlet that shows that Mormonism is NOT the same as Christianity and that unless one accepts Jesus in complete poverty of spirit as THE Son of God and THE only way to heaven and fellowship with God, IT IS NOT TRUE!JOHN 14:6 "I AM THE WAY, THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE AND NO ONE COMES TO THE FATHER EXCEPT BY ME!!!" (EMPHASIS MINE)
Example: [Printer Not Vista Compatible] The printer works great with my computer running XP SP1, but is not compatable with a newer computer running XP or any of my laptops that are running Vista. The fact that this printer is NOT Vista compatible should be highlighted.
Example: [Disappointed] I have no idea what this book really contains - I want to review the book, not really the prices, but what it containes so I know I am ording the right book, but all it says is Avon Bottles, Research and History. Research and history of what kind of old Avon bottles? It may not be the one I want or contains the bottles I want to price to sell. So basicly it's no good to me until I know what any of your books covers.
Example: [It's Been Too Long a Wait] The anticipation of the release of Joan's first album in nearly 8 years has been excruciating for her fans, but the wait has surely paid off with LOVERS SPEAK, her most effective release in years. Hearkening back to her earliest work, most notably her self-titled 1976 release, LOVERS SPEAK contains some of Joan's best songs ever, from the catchy title track, to the haunting "In These Times" (could this song's timing be more perfect?) to "Prove Yourself," an up-tempo, bluegrass-sounding tune that will have you singing along with its catchy chorus. As always, the songs are all Joan originals, with Joan providing all the vocals and most of the instrumentation. For the long-time Joan fan, and the new converts to her music, you will not be disappointed. It's a remarkable CD.
Example: [The BEST History of Art Ever Written!!!!] Whenever people mention art or art history, I think back to my Humanities classes at Michigan State. Gombrich's "The Story of Art" was a delighful text. Thorough, yet written in a way that was understandable to someone with very little exposure to art and all the nuances. "The Story of Art" makes the "Study" of art enjoyable. I have often regretted re-selling my text back to the book store since it would have made a wonderful reference. How delighted I am to find this book to still be available!!!
Example: [Great Buy!] These speakers are excellent! I wanted something for my computer so I could hear my DVD and play my games and it's great! No distortion at all!
Example: [Good IF experienced, don't touch if new to Java] Book has some errors, and if used ONLY for the test, you will fail. It glosses over a lot of topics and is good if you haven't touched Java in a while and need a refresher. I took the test after using this book and failed, looked up some questions I new I missed, and they weren't even in the book, no wonder I didn't pass. Got a more detailed book and passed easily. Barry Boone is good...just doesn't have a Java 2 book yet, but his ver. 1.1 book filled a LOT of gaps Brogden doesn't touch. Brogden says 'Native methods are not on the exam.' uh, yeah. Both times I took the exam, a question about Native methods was on the exam. Good for something...and that's a paperweight or a refresher.
Example: [Great packing tape that is thick and sound free.] I love this packing tape. It is thick and sturdy. It won't tear through heavy boxes. I used these for moving and they were very strong. Also what I really love is that it doesn't make sound when I unroll the tape.
Example: [Fake ?] Are you joking ? "Cobalt coated titanium"Titanium is HARDER than cobalt, why would you coat titanium with a rockwell hardness of 75 with cobalt that is only 65 ?I am sure these are junk without even buying them.
Example: [Notable improvement in performance] I got these about a week ago and changing the foil and blades introduced a notable improvement in the performance of the razor. It is almost as good as new now.
Example: [Thick Milk Shake Straws] These straws are great to use for old fashioned thick milk shakes that we make at our farm market. I was a little disappointed that the length was not specified clearly when I ordered-they are longer than what I was looking for, but they work ok.
Example: [Horrendous...] 1) This is an ancient reprint. The typeface used is very poor and the reproduction is often not dark or large enough.2) Only using a Romanization makes this book almost useless when working with a native speaker. Without reinforcing Chinese characters at every opportunity, the student is wasting their time.3) No explanation of pronounciation and tone system makes the book of ZERO value when trying to learn on your own. (I suppose if you already spoke Taiwanese, the book would have some value, but... why would you buy it if you already spoke Taiwanese?)4) There is no organization of grammar.5) Worst: I have no idea if Kejia Hua (Hokkien) is that similar to Taiwanese. This book is a "conversion" of a Hokkien book. Had the title clearly indicated as such, I certainly would not have bought this.6) Only positive: paper is suitable bonfire or latrine use.7) Consummer fraud any way you slice it... maybe ok at a yard sale of $0.25, but no more...
Example: [J'aime Oscar!] <3 <3 <3 <3 Classic, how can you NOT love Oscar Wilde? Fantastic selection of prose. <3 <3 <3 <3
Example: [pitiful] These hammers are the worse excuse for deadblow hammers I"ve ever seen.I wrote Cummins and they refuse to return my e-Mail.The product does not qualify for Industrial grade. Would not recommend to any mechanics.
Example: [Wait, Warner Brothers WILL rstore Popeye in 2007!] Warner Brothers is in the process of restoring the classic B&W and Color Popeye Cartoons for a 2007 release. Original Paramount main & end titles will be a part of the restoration.
Example: [A waste of time] Honestly, the biggest mystery with this book is how it got published. The author is a newspaper journalist, but he's thrown all his training out the window for this book as it meanders around, seemingly pointlessly, for page after page after dreary page.Maybe if I'd finished it I would have got the point. I didn't.
Example: [Dogs not interested] My dog are so uninterested in this that it might as well be invisible. I even put liver treats in it and tried to show them how to play with it. Neither dog would bother with it at all. (One is Female 4 yr old greyhound/lab/shephard mix, other is female 4 month old lab/border collie mix - both are very playful & love treats)Very disappointed.
Example: [Waste of money] I am sorry I bought this thing. It's way too complicated to set up, and yes, I read the instructions...they only added to my frustration. I would not recommend this product at all and will think 3 times before purchasing anything else from this manufacturer.
Example: [Don't Waste Your Money] I bought this book as a Christmas present for a friend thinking that I was getting him a great present. However, when I recieved the book, I opened it to see for myself how funny it really was. NOT FUNNY AT ALL! All this book consists of is mindless ramblings of celebrities and nothing at all even close to funny. I never ended up giving this to my friend because it was so lame. I showed the book to my Mom to see if maybe she knew someone who liked corny stuff... she told me she would never give that book to anyone. I am not the kind of person who is hard to entertain. Usually if a see a someone get kicked in the face on T.V., I'm laughing all day. I'm looking at the book now trying to find some "fabulous" quoteto share with you, but SURPRISE! There does not exist even ONE that is worthy. You can be sure that I'm sending this one back!
Example: [Excellent Muffler] This is perfect for my ride and what I wanted. A muffler which has a sporty look, which is quiet enough for daily driving, but comes alive when I put my foot down and the v-tec kicks in (JDM 2000 Honda Accord SiR).
Example: [Weak] Nothing special about this. Whitewash is pure garbage. I get the point behind it, but why must these types of film always be about the struggle of black people? I'm not racist, but don't really like being stereotyped as a bleach-white faced jerk.
Example: [A must buy] This movie takes you back to the New York's golden age, when women got thier hair done to go out to dinner and men wore suits to the go see the Dodger's play. In the middle of it all was Toots Shore, restaurant owner and friend of many, if you had a dollar you could go ot Toots and have a drink. My grandparents and parents told me of the great times they had there, and after seeing the film, I only wish I could've been there with them.....
Example: [THEY ROCK!] They are awesome! You can tell just by listening to the way they sing they really have a love for God! They're sooo good! They're my favorite!
Example: [Perfect] This went in my new cabinets and is a second one, as I already had one. It's exactly what I need and does exactly what it says. I set my cabinets up with my adjustable shelves so that I can hang glasses upside down and still have space underneath to put other glasses. I've already had envious looks from people who come and see my new kitchen.
Example: [Just what I needed!] Right price, very easy to set up, quieter than my treadmill or old exercise bike, and I can use my own bike. I use a "bike leveler" for the front wheel. I change gears to change the level of intensity of my workout. I'm not a bike pro nor a "spinner" - so I don't need a lot of bells and whistles - so this suits my needs perfectly, without having to make a huge investment in expensive equipment. Note: I had a helper when setting up my bike in the trainer.
Example: [Rucker the Millionaire] This game was fun and exciting, it gave me the change to apply some of the things I was learning in ECON to real life, it also had an competitive aspect were you compete with the computer and its actaully a challenge!!! Played this game for hours while listening to Personal development, great game.-Rucker the MillionaireMan of God
Example: [Gotta love the [...] kicking old farts] As a 50 year old runner and biker, I loved this book. I am now firmly entrenched in middle age and need the occasional inspiration to get out on the trails of Houston especially during the brutally hot summers. This book is full of what I need. A beautifully photographed and written book portraying active seniors competing and loving life, some well into their 90s. Truly amazing. The book is generally formatted with a picture and a few paragraphs written about and in some cases by these special people. By personal favorite is 83 year old surfer "Woody" Brown pictured with his 6 year old son Woody Jr. (Yep.... do the math) A copy of their picture is posted on my refrigerator for those days I hesitate to lace up the running shoes.
Example: [An energizing routine, led by Brazilian dance and fitness instructor Vanessa Isaac] Brazilian Dance Workout is a high-energy cardio-workout DVD for all fitness levels, inspired by the exciting rhythms of Brazilian dance. Samba, Samba Reggae, Axe, African and Frevo moves blend in an energizing routine, led by Brazilian dance and fitness instructor Vanessa Isaac. Bonus audio tracks include a Brazilian percussion mix and the "Hip Brazil" theme by Randy Tico. An enthusiastically toe-tapping addition to personal fitness library and exercise routine DVD shelves, highly recommended for men and women of all ages looking for motivation to get moving and healthy. 60 min., color.
Example: [Should be zero stars] Bought after Thanksgiving as a Christmas present for my daughter. Opened on Christmas morning with what we thought were dead batteries, I tried 3 different sets of brand new batteries and the cash register just flat does not work. I've been trying to initiate a return through Amazon for 3 days now, and every time I get to the return page the site freezes up. Hopefully when Amazon gets their return page working, they will allow a return after their 30 day limit, or I will never order anything from them again.**1/8/13 Finally able to log in to Amazon for a return, printed return labels w\out problem, hopefully they will refund without an issue as well.
Example: [Life on the Other Side Review] Sylvia Browne does an excellant job describing exactly what the title inferes, Life on the Other Side. Anyone even remotely interested in what Heaven is like, should read this amazing book. Sylvia explanins how she "knows what she knows" Skeptics will be convinced, and believers will nod in agreement. Sylvia uses humor and biblical references to back up her beliefs, and I, for one, am looking forward to returning home.
Example: [Scratched Discs. Someone should be flogged] The others reviews about scratched disks are right on the money. I had no idea, and hadn't read any reviews before I bought. Do NOT buy the Limited Edition version, unless they repackage it. Shameful that they put out such a poor product design for such a huge release. What a fiasco. Both my discs were rolling around inside and all scratched up. I hope Best Buy doesn't give me a problem with the return. I'm sure the game itself is 5 star. This edition of it is 1 star.
Example: [Are you kidding???] I purchased this item on June 21. It was great for, um, a month and 10 days. Now it is no longer working. That is crazy.
Example: [Unstoppable leaks began about 2 weeks after installation] As is typical (unfortunately) with on-tap water filters, and threaded parts seem to be made of soft plastic. This unit was fine the first day, but after using it for a week or so, the leaks began, spraying water in all directions whenever you try to use filter. And if you bump the filter, it falls off the faucet. I didn't even get through the first filter before I had to give it up as a bad job.Don't get this one. It's as bad as the Brita.
Example: [a very bad book] This is a very bad book, it's full of stupid questions and dumb explanations, e.g. the 3rd math multiple question of the 2nd section of the first of two practice exam did not even contain the answer for the question, and the explanation to the question is an error. .
Example: [One disc, 16 hits.] I do realize there's the 2-disc "Chronicles" collection, as well as others, but being a minor fan this made the most sense to me. It has most everything you've heard on the radio (hence the title), plus some. Included is "Fly By Night", "Closer To The Heart", "Freewill", "New World Man", and the popular "Tom Sawyer". Plus it ends with my favorite "Time Stand Still", with guest vocals from "Aimee Mann". The only thing I wish they had fit on is "Show Don't Tell", from the album "Presto". Some copies of this came with a bonus DVD with lyrics and 5 videos too. Overall, these songs are a real "Rush", and it's a great collection for the casual fan.
Example: [Who are these people?] This book is a good read. It has forbiden sex and suspense. But it has it's flaws. The protagonist, Ted Swenson is a creative writing professor at a small New England college. One of his criteria for good writing is that the characters have to be believable. It is interesting to apply his principles to the novel itself. Swenson comes off as quite believable, but his nemisis, Angela Argo is not. Her destructive actions have no conceivable motive. She is too clever and her timing is too acurate to suppose that she is psychotic. Likewise, the campus atmosphere is not like anything I have ever seen(for example, the English Department party), and while sex between faculty and students has become no-no, the description of the faculty meeting on this subject is an unbelievable exageration of the PC attitudes that prevail. What saves the book is the portrayal of Swenson. I have met him - many of him. And there are parts of himin every middleaged man.
Example: [Another good one.] Just as enjoyable as the first book. It's a pleasure to be reading a book that you look forward to picking up. Great and uplifting characters.
Example: [Excellent] This book has TONS of useful information from birth to death. Really is a resource to save!!
Example: [Terrible Film. Do Not Waste Your Time or Money!] This was hands down the most pointless, boring movie I have ever seen. I went to see this film simply because Clint Eastwood has been making very good movies lately. I figured that this film would more of the same of his work.This movie was slow, boring, and lacked substance. It made you believe that within the next scene or the scene after that, something would happen to make the movie interesting. This film was so poorly done that I decided to wait for friends in the lobby of the theater instead of enduring any more of this film.Do yourself a favor, do not watch this film. You will waste money and more importantly, time.
Example: [Great Video!!! – Worth Every Penny!!!] I received this just recently and found the video to be very detailed and provided everything I needed to take care of my AR 15. In addition, they went over a bit of history regarding the AR and also explained the ammunition used in the AR. If you are looking for a video that will explain the details of how your AR rifle works I would recommend this product 100%!!!! Excellent!!!!!
Example: [It's Ok] This book is only ok. The images are interesting to my 2-month baby, but not as exciting to him asLook, Look!. The animals are nice, but they don't provide as much inspiration for conversation asHello, Animals! (Black and White Sparklers). Overall, ok, but it rarely comes off the book shelf.
Example: [First movie I ever walked out on] Never in my 34 years have I ever walked out on a movie, but I did with Amelia. So I guess you should take this review with a grain of salt since I only saw about 45 minutes of the movie. But man were those 45 minutes BAD!!! I usually like Hilary Swank, but her acting in this movie was just...weird - as if Amelia Earhart had Assberger's or something. Her acting was so stilted and wooden that it was really hard to relate to the character. There's no way anyone actually talks that way, unless there's something wrong with them.As for the story itself...it just didn't go anywhere - or if it did eventually, it took longer than 45 minutes. I can't really say much more about it because I can't even remember what happened in those 45 minutes, either because nothing in particular happened, or it was so bad that I blocked it out. This movie was so bad it almost makes it worth watching to marvel at its badness...but not quite.
Example: [return this now] Allstar Baseball 2003 was terrible. ASB2001 was the best of all. It was too hard to hit the ball even on rookie mode. The instruction manual told me nothing. It was so overrated. Too little gameplay and the person who made this game should be fired and thrown out on the street.
Example: [I have never tried an anti-perspirant before (only ...] I have never tried an anti-perspirant before (only deodorants) and so I was a little worried about skin reactions, but all was well. I liked the product. It has a good (not overpowering) smell, and my wife likes the smell, too, which is a VERY good thing. One difference between this and other similar products is the scent, which is more like a cologne than a deodorant. If that's what you're looking for, then that would be a significant advantage. I would recommend this product to friends and family.
Example: [A Bitter Wind Blows] I've made several comments against bitterant on other air dusters and in the end I went with this one because there weren't any comments (at the time) stating whether or not it included it or not and nothing in the description at that time noting its presence either. Its no surprise now (as other reviewers have commented) that I got "bit." Yes the product contains bitterant, but not to a degree that I could detect from smell, though others may be more sensitive to its smell than myself. Aside from that it does do the job it is supposed to do, initially. The air pressure drops after a few sprays and it becomes all but ineffective. I ordered two packs (4 cans) and the result was always the same. I'd bought a different brand at Staples about a year ago, that really did the job down to the last spray, but of course they were out of it at the time. One could definitely do better than this.
Example: [Well-written, repulsive] I almost stopped reading this book when one of the main characters went mad and began consuming his own excrement. If this doesn't put you off, perhaps you could overcome a natural revulsion and enjoy the author's excellent writing style. I couldn't. Be warned that this book does not end by giving the reader an uplifting feeling. The writing is powerful enough that you won't be able to forget it; personally, I sincerely regret that.
Example: [nice collection] This book is wonderful. I personally loved Curious George as a kid and I wanted to pass those stories along to my son, and what better way than all the original stories in one book! It takes up so much less space and costs much less than buying each book separately. Well worth the money.
Example: [Good Product] I bought this mp3 player so I could download music from napster. I use it at the gym, run it thru the radio in my car and hook it up to speakers and listen to music at work.The only complaint I have is that sometimes you have to keep hitting buttons to get where you want on the menu. Other than that, I'm very happy with the player's performance.
Example: [Lovely children's book] If I could I'd give this to all new parents. This story of little creatures who can't let themselves fall asleep out of fear of missing something will sound familiar to anyone who's tried to put a reluctant child to sleep. But the real take-away is how the blind snake Kartusch teaches these little ones to appreciate their world on a deeper level and how to develop inner peace. Of course children aren't born knowing these things, the sooner they learn them the happier they'll be!
Example: [Non classic boys choir] This music is haunting. I was inspired by the film Chorus and promptly searched for a recording and was grateful to find it on Amazon. The original music is beautifully performed by Les Petites Chanteurs de Saint-Marc choir with the inspired voice of the solist Jean-Baptiste Maunier. The words are inspiring and original as well; although in French, there is a translation in the little booklet accompanying the CD. "Look to your path," my favorite song says, "Children lost, forgotten, give them a hand to lead them to other tomorrows." I also recommend the film which is a brilliant study in leadership, humanity and warmth.
Example: [happy with purchase] i am very happy with the eureka boss, the price was very affordable, the attachments are easy to use. i have used it on wood floors also and its better than sweeping. the foot pedal to lower it into position to vacuuum is a little stiff and hard to depress. i would recommend buying this vacuum
Example: [One of the worst books EVER] Hard to believe this was written by the author of the masterful 'Water for Elephants' in fact I don't believe it! How could it be???This was such an awful book I kept thinking there was some type of trick up the author's sleeve. But alas, it really was just a bad book.Read the other 1-star reviews, they are all true, accurate and honest. The book is unbelievably maddening and the main character, Annemarie, sickening.I loved 'Water for Elephants' but will NEVER waste my time reading another Sara Gruen book. I feel as if someone cheated me out of a portion of my life. If it wasn't for the fact that I had a Book on CD version, I could never have gotten through it.Yuck!!!
Example: [Don't buy it] The product comes with zero support. In order to get any support on the product you have to purchase a separate support contract.EDIT: I wanted to be sure I pointed out that the reseller of this product, Dominant Systems, is excellent. I had a problem with registration of the product and they promptly helped me correct the issue. Unfortunately the product itself is not something I'd buy again, but it's not Domninant Systems fault in any way.
Example: [Logitech Cordless Rumblepad 2 with Vibration Feedback] This item does not work with any of the new games, had to send it back for a refund.
Example: [Crazy Taxi] A very satisfying game. If your thinking of buying it, don't, just go buy it now. If you have played the arcade version, just add an extra stage, optional time limits andd the crazy box and you get Crazy Taxi for Dreamcast. Buy it. Its one of those games that you actually want to play after a month.
Example: [editing outdated] Focus on Pronunciation 1 (Book & CD)The book now has a new version. This version is no longer used by teachers. Not changed, nor returned because it is not worth. The cost of postage is high, but I would get my money in credit or discount on amazon.com
Example: [Gallager, you were the greatest] I remember Gallager while I was growin up. Tried to go see him several times in Atlanta, Ga and Charlottee, NC, and could not get tickets. I did see him several time on HBO specials. He is so funny is his own way. So now I have part of his collection.
Example: [Very cheap plastic game] The game didn't work when we received it and calling customer support did get us a new one. It's all plastic, really easy to break. There's a switch that counts clicks when you turn the board. Some chip in there keeps track and our 'chip' was bad according to customer support. If your kids will use it for one or two times, then you should be fine. We got a replacement and it worked for a day.
Example: [Excellent early warning system] Now we know when someone is approaching our house...one beep for the driveway, two beeps at the front door, three beeps means the back door and four beeps means the back yard. We are never surprised.
Example: [Great trap...but be forewarned] This trap did its job perfectly on the first night trying to trap a pesky raccoon. I used crumbled bacon and at 4am I awoke to a HUGE (even the animal control guy was shocked by the size) raccoon shaking the cage trying to escape. What I wasn't prepared for was the huge mess the raccoon created! Fecal matter everywhere...pee everywhere...and shredded cardboard everywhere(I hid the cage under a cardboard box not knowing the raccoon would be able to reach through the cage and shred it. Don't forget to check with your state's Dept. of Natural Resources before trapping (you need a permit in MD and many other states). I really felt bad for the raccoon but I am happy not to have him waking me up every night trying to rip my trash cans to shreds to get inside.
Example: [Do not waste your money!] O.k. This is another one of those deceptive DVD's. You think that there will be interaction between the "Sorority Girls" but in reality what you get are 6 single ten minute nude portfolios of average looking women. The DVD could have been called "Tepid, desperate women looking for employment." No relation to sororities at all. The women are o.k. looking - some with tattoos, some with piercings, and the photography is fine - more explicit than Playboy, less explicit than Penthouse. Bottom line = very, very boring. You've been warned. Don't make the mistake I did. Save your $15.00 on something else.
Example: [Great game for a 3yr old!] My daughter got Click Start for Christmas and the past two days it has been all she has wanted to play with, she loves it and it has been great for her. Yesterday she couldn't operate it herself but today she can accurately move the mouse and she has only played it an hour total both days! I am very pleased with this purchase. The only thing I can think will be a negative is that there are very few games for it, we have two because the other ones didn't really appeal to us, it'd be great if they came out with more games.
Example: [groundbreaking] This book was the first of its kind and caused uproar within the British police ranks when it was first published in 1993. Based on the author's PhD research with anonymous officers, the book contains both a semi-academic introduction to each issue but consists mostly of edited interviews with gay and lesbian police officers that are easy and interesting reading. The combination of Burke's socio-psychological observations along with the spoken word, make this book compelling and it remains a must read for all police officers and anyone else who still mis-understands what it really means to be gay.
Example: [My controller] My controller didnt charge when connected with the cord available and the pins were partially bent when i took a closer look. Will have to buy another charger (probably the docking one). The controller was scratched but other than that, i got what i wanted, which was another controller and it works.
Example: [The Aims of Argument] The book came in before school started (Kudos) and was in very good shape. It came via United Parcel Service, and I always like that because the United States Postal Service always drags their feet, and the carriers do not pay attention to the mail they actually deliver (every book that has been sent via USPS I have had to call the Postmaster to find it).I appreciate your promptness and hope to do business with you again.
Example: [Uhhhh!] Why are we forced to read some of the most boring books in the world!?! Here's the setup. A mother abandons her children in a car so the children decide to go from Rhode Island to Conneticutt(or is it the other way around?) Sounds interesting right? Well it isn't. Most of the time the book's talking about their walk to their destination. My opinion is that this is a bad book.
Example: [Duct tape and bubble gum] Had the sole coming apart after 155 miles of trail. Used super glue to hold them together for another section of the AT. Keen, you gotta be kidding me! Everything else about the boot is fine, but to lose it's basic function on account of glue? Just stupid!
Example: [kiss the future is the future now!!!dub!!!!] this completely blew me away. i;ve never been a on u sound or mark stewart completist . for me this hits the best dub moments of stewart's career. i've read reviews that say this isn't complete enough. how could it be, stewart's been around awhile. still, the dubbed out tracks on here make you realize the dub genius of adrian sherwood and mark stewart. the pop group really updated dub in the era of the late 70's. stewart continued and continues to break ground in the area of distorted-in your face- dub productions. from track 1 - 12 i had a huge smile on my face!
Example: [Excelente cd..maravilloso sonido!!!] ESte cd de John Coltrane es realmente una maravilla. Encontramos aquí a un grandioso maestro del jazz que con profundidad y virtuosismo nos presenta una selección de temas que contienen la quintaesencia del jazz. Este maravilloso saxofonista tenor nos trae el recuerdo de otro grande del bebop como fue Charlie Parker. Los 05 temas son bellísimos, destacando las dos baladas: "I Want To Talk About You" y el homenaje al fallecido saxofonista de Dizz "Theme For Ernie". Maravillosa improvisación en el tema "Russian Lullaby".Una verdadera joya del jazz que apreciamos en una excelente presentación en LP sleeve y una magnífica remasterización.
Example: [Punk Guru Is Weak!] Claw Hammer is not A 90's Punk Band.To compare them to NOFX A Kiddie Punk Band is nonsense.I've seen Claw Hammer and the talent they have is above and beyond anything NOFX could put out!Pablum Rocks, and I'm sure Bad Religon feels the same way.(Guru My ASS!!!)
Example: [Very disappointed] I am very disappointed with this item. I bought it for my granddaughter and initially loved the set. It was beautiful but upon actual use of it in the crib, it began to tear at the seams and fray all over. It is unsafe to even have it in the crib. It is definitely pretty but not worth it if you can't use it.
Example: [Dad knows!] Like the fist one this was a delight to read. Some more insight into Anna's world and the way she experiance God. I loved it!
Example: [Broken] I used the Cebrax MP3 play less than 5 minutes and its display quit working. A few phone calls later we found out that we needed to return the player and get it replaced. Maybe the replacement will last longer...
Example: [It does rain in S.CA!] What a great song on a pretty darn good cd. This is TTT's best cd, anniversary is their best song, but this is by far their best cd!
Example: [Not getting the product] I never received the item. I waited and waited for the shipment. I contacted the seller, but got not answer. I wish Amazon would be certain of the seller's commitment to fulfill an order. I wasted a lot of time waiting for the product. This seller should be banned!
Example: [Display Stopped Working] After less than one year of use, the display for the clock stopped working. When I called RCA to complain and get a replacement, they told me they had no record of my warrantee submission, and that they would do nothing for me without a receipt. Either keep your receipt or look for another product.
Example: [Old cliches put into a new format, or not so new.] Slow begining. A bunch of stuff already done before. . .over all, I wouldn't say it's a terrible book, it was okay. This will not go down in history as one of George Lucas's greater creations, not even really in the GOOD catagory. It's just another book about a race of people who have slaves and one of them decides to break free from thier evil ways. I wouldn't recremend this to you people out there who like alot of space-faring action, or like anything face paced, because this is not the book for you.
Example: [Don't waste your money] I seldom write a review like this one, but trust me when I say this was a total waste. This is not only a waste of money it's a waste of plastic. The switches don't lock, you usualy tell when they are in the down position,and the pin sockets are so weak that they drop the connection. It wasn't worth the price of shipping or I would have sent it back instead of tossing it.
Example: [Almost a perfect product] It's light ... it's adjustable ... it's affordable. I only wish you could tilt the pedal as well as raise it up and down. That would make it perfect.
Example: [Absolutely Useless] Don't bother to buy this. The instructions are like trying to read a translation from Japanese assembly instructions for some incomprehensible machine. I was totally unable to translate his instructions into any usefull movement. For example he says, "With both your elbows pointing 45 digrees at the dance floor relax your underarms and push the upper arms up by flexing all the muscles that surround the front, side, and back of your rib cage." I don't know about you but this instruction is useless for me.I am currently using this book as a hot-pad in my kitchen.
Example: [track listing] 1. Tiny Meat (original version)2. Tiny Meat (danny saber mix)3. Heidi (scream team mix)Austrian Import.1995 Creation Records Limited
Example: [Disappointing] I had never heard of Cornelius but I was intrigued and thought I would give this a shot. I was looking for some neat video/animation together with some interesting music. With the hopes of being pleasantly surprised I ordered my copy. I must say that I was disappointed in the music as well as most of the videos. The sound is excellent but the only decent video here, in my opinion, is drop. Most of the music is really corny and the last video is plain horrible. If your really interested try to rent this before you spend your money!
Example: [wireless on a PDA] Easy enough to use, install the software and plug it in.There are a couple of small issues with it though:When setting it up, the field for the network id on a WEP connection will not let you enter a long value. It appears to run out of space, at least it stops accepting characters. You have to write it elsewhere and cut/past it in.The power management is poor. The power management setting of on (or even auto) drains the battery. The manual is no help, just repeatedly stating:Power Management is a power saving mode. The lower power consumption may also lower the wireless performance. To enable Power Management, select On. To disable Power Management, select Off.The power LED stay on, even when the PDA hibernates. I have to remove the card to prevent this.
Example: [The thin blue review] Rowan Atkinson, TV's Mr Bean and Blackadder had another show that ran for 2 seasons in england and this is it. Not as great as the other shows but a good solid comedy with Rowan Atkinson doing another type of role. He might have been the star of the show but he was more of a straight man to the crazy crew.
Example: [not recommended] This is more a compendium of the author's prejudices and rantings, defensively rendered, than a book about arranging. All the examples are from his own works--he is not recognized as a significant composer. I learned much more from "Inside the Score" by Rayburn Wright, and I recommend this book instead.Also recommended: PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST by JEFF BURNS.
Example: [Album of the Year] Here it is folks, after a 7 year hiatus, the Wrens we know and love are back...or are they? Well, the truth is they're certainly back, but they've changed much since Secaucus. The first thing you'll noticed is they've lost a bit of the edginess on display in Secaucus. Instead of up-beat, immediately catchy pop tunes, the Wrens sound has matured into down-beat, immediately heart-wrenching songs of failure and endless breakups. As a result, with Meadowlands, the Wrens have reached a new emotional level not only in their own work, but in their genre as well. When "Happy" blessed my ears for the first time, I knew then that this is the best album of 2003. Don't pass this album up, you'll be sorry you did.
Example: [Don't be tempted by the novelty...] Like many others here, the unit did NOT work right out of the box! The Check Tank button repeatedly lit, despite following all the "tips" for addressing the problem. Finally sat on the floor next to it, hitting Power, Power, Clean everytime the check tank button lit. After 20-30 button hit cycles, it finally started up. Lets see, its 11 pm now, it started cleaning 2 hours ago. I figure by morning the kitchen, (less than 100 sq feet!) might finally be cleaned! If I had gotten off my backside, I could have swept and mopped the kitchen, and vacuumed and shampooed the living room carpet! Steer clear of this useless "toy."
Example: [too far-out for me] I love books like this, and thought I would love Vast (my first Nagata). But I had to put it down after about 25% of the way through. The characters were all so alien, that I couldn't relate to any of them. The "hard-science" was so futuristic, that it wasn't even plausible -- and no attempt to explain it. I can't recommend this book, but I will try other books by Nagata and hope this was just a fluke. :-)
Example: [I love Tango] I loved this video. Maybe because I love Argentine Tango. There is so much individuality expressed by each of the eight couples, that it seems like Tango has no limits. This dance is for everyone. It has everything to satisfy anybody's taste. The quality of dancers in this show is world-class. It is hard to imagine how it can get much better, but somehow I believe that most of these couples have not reached their peaks yet. Marvelous video!
Example: [A hard blow to psuedoscience] Pretty much a book that dissects human beliefs and offers rational explanation for everything. It takes the fun out of things like alien invasions and ghosts, but it makes the reader more informed. Good for people who want scientific explanation for everything, but a harsh reality check for those who engage in more whimsical and alternative belief systems.
Example: [late shipping] I ordered this CD on June 30 and it is now Aug 7 and it has not shipped yey - promised date missed twice - now saying it will ship Aug 23. I would not buy from them again.
Example: [Adjustable width but VERY thin plastic vinyl window shade] I bought this item for my classroom since I couldn't find the correct width of a shade anywhere else. In the instructions to have the shade fit the window, the roller was adjustable and the shade was able to be torn to fit the roller. It attached then to the roller with double sided tape already on the roller. But the shade was so thin, that just attaching it to the roller, made it rip more. Room Darkening??? No, way.... It does say "Economy" on the package. Maybe there are different levels of room darkening. I don't feel for the price that I received an equal quality item.
Example: [Why do Leaves Change color?] It is a very educational book. I am not sure though that the age range is correct. I think It may be hard for a 4 year old to all take in. There is quite the detail about information we only learn in our later years.
Example: [The Body Smart System, a true life saver] I first used this diet nine years ago and it has changed my life. I lost lots of weight,my allergies disappeared and my thyroid problem disappeared. I plan to order this book for my relatives in hopes that they can also be helped.
Example: [Groovy] This book is a really fun read. If you like Bruce Campbell, don't miss it. If you don't like Bruce Campbell, get yourself checked out. Enjoy!
Example: [Spiritual Gift] Dr. Wayne Dyer is a man who is spiritually grounded and he shares his knowledge in this book. It was a good read and a quick one but one that you will go back to time and again.
Example: [watched it a second time and i realized...] this movie stinks, annoying acting, stupid ending beyond belief...special features are non-existint dont be sucked in to that (2 movie versions crap) it's not just a different ending which sucks horribly....worth and rent thats it..
Example: [Many Questions] This book had many strong moments as well as weak moments. The points it tries-to- make at times were hard to follow.
Example: [Community Organizing and Social Activism Essentials] This book is particularly good for understanding the relationships between the organizer/facilitator and the grass roots community activists, for understanding what can be done during down times when social movements are least active, and for understanding the role of education in the transformation of society.
Example: [Good product] This is a good product the only problem is it is a bit messy. The juice leaks from the top and drains down on the side. This is the best buy for your money.
Example: [The third-best Star Trek movie ever!] The movie suffers a bit from a tight budget (ckeck out Valaris sliding down a ladder and hitting a bulkhead. The whole wall shakes. But all that aside this is the one of the strongest Trek films only bettered by II and First Contact. The principles of Star Trek are closely adhered to and the Cast Autograph sign off at the end of the movie was a GREAT way to end the last trek movie to have the complete old-series cast. This movie will not disappoint in the least and will keep you on the edge of your seat through the final act.
Example: [where is this all going?] one of the few books that I could not finish.In fact I couldn't stand it any longer. The author(of stayed in India(?) for some time tries desperately to infuse the 'indian ethos or culture' into the book unsuccessfully. The attempt is really lame. Being an Indiphile does not help when you're trying to read this one.sorry. 1 star.
Example: [Very cool,] This was an interesting movie. It takes ALOT to scare me when I watch Horrors, this one was so plot thickened that it ALMOST scared me. It kind of reminded me of the Abyss, which is't scary and really had nothing to do with this. But none the less, It is a Carpenter movie, and it is a MUST see!
Example: [Tropical Getaway is the perfect read!] Wow!! I really loved this book. The story is fast paced and keeps you riveted from page one. Dane is an AWESOME hero. Very sexy, and some of his lines made me shiver. I loved him. Ava is fun and fiesty. Her brother, Marco's story line is beautifully done. I definately recommend Tropical Getaway and can't wait to read Roxanne St. Claire's next book.
Example: [Sucky bottles] These bottles are the worst I've ever seen. My son could not get latched on correctly, the nipples were too small, and then when he drank from them it went down way to quickly. And why should a bottle be so complicated that you have to either hold it just right or screw the lid on just right, not to tight you know. Who wants to mess with that in the middle of the night. We switched to the playtex natural latch and everything was much better. Yes you have the bags, but there is no leaking and no extra air. I only use these bottle with my pump and even then they are a pain in the butt, because they don't want to stay screwed to the pump. ERRR!! Very frustrating.
Example: [Great Movie] This movie mirrors real life and then hands it over to the audience for resolution. You will be pleased with this picture.
Example: [This album will bring you back...] My husband and I attended both high school and college in the 80s, resulting in us being huge fans of the decade's music for life--we even had all 80s music at our recent wedding! This album is part of our vast 80s music collection; it's such a must-have that we bought a replacement when our old CD player destroyed our original copy. The songs wil take you back both to the movie and to the decade, starting with the title track, "Pretty in Pink," a huge mainstream hit by a non-mainstream group, the Psycedelic Furs. Other hits from the album include OMD's "If You Leave" and "Left of Center" by Suzanne Vega. My favorite, however, is "Wouldn't it Be Good," a Nik Kershaw tune nicely covered here by the Danny Hutton Hitters. Finally, fans of more obscure 80s groups such as New Order are likely to enjoy the remaining songs on this tape. For the sake of both nostalgia and the music itself, this album is a must-have addition to any 80s collection.
Example: [It's cute ^_^] I bought this CD when I was like 14 (I'm 18 now), and I still enjoy listening to it. Basically, it's "cute" - the songs are from the first season of Sailor Moon. I've been wanting the songs like "Oh Starry Night" and "My Only Love" ever since I heard them on the show, and I was so excited to hear that they came out with a CD. I like almost all of the songs, except for maybe one or two. Bonus: you get the lyrics, which is useful, because there were some lines I wasn't sure about. I recommend it for young girls, and anyone who enjoys watching the show. I think the soundtrack really goes well with the dubbed show, and I think shows need soundtracks to make them more memorable. It's a shame they didn't make more songs for the other seasons.
Example: [LOUD!] This fan is everything as advertised - and more. The oscillating feature is SO LOUD, it make this fan impractical for a bedroom. I would recommend this product - but only in its non-oscillating mode!
Example: [Terrific Product] After much looking I found this the Lenox on Line. It is by far the best Ice Bucket we have owned and several of our friends were so impressed they too have purchased it. Strongly recommend.
Example: [Amazing, as usual] Yu Watase never fails to deliver, and this book is no exception. Dramatic, enticing, eloquent, heart-wrenching, beautifully tragic. What more can I say? Yu Watase does push some emotional buttons here, taking her well-developed characters to the max and putting them in situations that show their true colors(especially Yuhi...read the book, and you'll see what I mean). If you've seen the anime and think you don't need to read the manga, you're completely wrong...So much was left out of the tv series...The characters really are taken to a whole new level(especially Shuro,in my opinion(but that's another book, not this one...). Please check this out. I can guaruntee you will NOT be dissappointed, maybe a little depressed...Just prepare yourself for angst and turmoil^^;!
Example: [One word. Greedo.] The word Greedo can sum up two major points of these dvds.1. He does NOT shoot first. Why would Lucas feel the need to change this? And Greedo must have had one too many Cantina drinks if he could miss from a distance of 1 foot...2. Greedo - o = greed.Lucas and his Special Editions, terrible new trilogy, edits, etc, are nothing but a chance to milk the franchise dry. Leave the classics alone! Isnt the Skywalker ranch big enough?
Example: [Radiohead stinks] If you like radiohead your stupid. Lol. You are probably some really dumb boso college student who trys to act rebbellious and just listens to radiohead for the hell of it. Dont get this... this is their worst album which is just sad. Radiohead stinks!
Example: [Tennis Balls As Good As Dryer Balls! And Less $$!] I did a little test while I was visiting my Daughter-In-Law, who possesses not only Dryer Balls, but a nice supply of tennis balls. For the test I washed two feather pillows from our motor home, which had become musty during storage. I washed them separately, each with a towel to balance the load. After washing, I dried each set with a dryer sheet in addition to the balls, mostly for fragrance: one set of pillow and towel with the dryer balls and one set with two tennis balls. Both thumped noisily around in the dryer and both walloped the feather pillows and towels back to equal fluffiness. I had considered purchasing dryer balls, but my daughter-in-law contributed the two test tennis balls and I am have been perfectly happy with the results.
Example: [I've got to get home to that good pie.] An astronomer, Dan Aykroyd as Steve Mills, by way of a fluke, sends a message out of the galaxy. This causes a gravitational instability on that quadrant. An alien embassary, Kim Basinger as Celeste Martin, is sent to find and correct the problem. She is accompanied by Bag (Ann Prenttiss) who is ready to destroy anyone that gets in the way.There are lots of misunderstandings and sight gages. However the Alien learns of love and people (including Jimmy Durante). This movie is just too jam-packed with fun to describe. You will have to see it again and again to pick up the parts that went by too fast.
Example: [Great deal] Best price I could find, exactly what I needed and it arrived so quickly I didn't have time to track it!!!
Example: [Easily my favorite router ever] I love this router. I've purchased, hacked, and installed at least 30 of these things, and there simply isn't a better , more reliable router on the market.With the stock configuration, this router still edges out the competition, but once you replace the firmware it blows everything else out of the water with ease. Not even close.The most basic replacement firmware (Tomato) gives you as much functionality in this router as high-end equipment. I can do some pretty cool stuff with it, the most basic of which is boost the wireless signal strength by about 300%.
Example: [Gripping, Fascinating legal arguments] A good whodunnit for holiday reading. Not the best of this author's books that I hacve read. Lacks the depth of research apparent in such books as In the name of honour.
Example: [You need to have this books] This is a outstanding source that you need in the study of the biblcal world.
Example: [Only one good thing about this book] There is only one thing surrounding this book that is any good.... The five star reviews on here. I suggest reading them as they are filled with delusional and hilarious posts. On a side note, yes there is a Church of Satan, you can even visit their website, but they just worship another make believe entity. What's the difference?
Example: [Not impressed] Thought this would be a good way to avoid bloody fingers when slicing onions. Hard to push into onions and does not make consistent slices. I usually only got 2-3 decent slices per attempt so I no longer even bother to try to use it to slice an onion. I would like to be fair though and state that it does an ok job for thin tomato slices. That's the only thing that hss kept it out of the trash can. Only rated 1 star because it is listed as an onion holder.
Example: [water from a stone] how much money needs to be made on the fan of these fantastic movies? this product is a disrespectful, cynical installment in the continuing rip-off of the fan--shameful. the director's cuts will be the next release--that should have been this release--do not buy.
Example: [not a good price, for a mediocar product.] Cabinet LEDs work better, are slimmer and brighter (dimable by tape, plastic film or dimmer switch.)two of these barely lit my 30 gallon. was not happy with them.
Example: [Signs of the times...] This book illustrates, with some technical form, the artful, whimsical commercial signage of days past. If you're wistful or nostalgic about the wild neon and bright painted signage you saw or like from the golden ages of the fifties and sixties, this book is for you! It's chock full of signage, specs and discussions of the form and substance of fanciful advertising. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves the imagery found all along the Mother Road..and beyond!
Example: [No rocking as your rolling along] I purchased this item for my husband who travels every week with his job. He likes it because it's more convenient than the window mount, and it stays put.Since it fits easily in his briefcase, he not only uses it in his own car, he also takes it with him on business trips all over the country. He's very happy with it, and has already recommended it to friends and colleagues.
Example: [One song worth it all] This song alone is worth the price of the CD: A Hundred Thousand Angels - Bliss
Example: [Works Great] Great Product. I use Windows 7 and it works great. I do not use the sleep function or Hibernate on ether one of my computers so it is not a problem.
Example: [TOO BOUNCY] Could NOT stop bouncing--took over four minutes just to stop bouncying. Hit my head on ceiling--familiy say sI'm not nearly the same. Handle won't come off so you can't store it probably. Also, my cat hates blue. HATES IT. Very angry. Did not come in any soft tones--ridickoulusl. Is not pet safe--TOO BOUNCY. Next time don't go with rubber.
Example: [movie] Bought this for my 10 year old daughter - she is not interested in it. Haven't made it all the way through movie - lost interest and did something else.
Example: [smooth and silky] I bought it for my wife and she says it is the best product of its type she has used. She has tried them all and thinks this is best.
Example: [The Beatles remixed and reworked into a beautiful sound collage!!! Groovy baby!!!] Great job Sir George Martin and son Giles for remixing and reworking these timeless classics into a beautiful,colourful soung collage for the mind!!!,and of course the Beatles(John Paul,George and Ringo) themselves for creating such timeless music that will live on for eternity!!! It's been reworked but it works here in spades!!! Just pop in Love in the CD player and enjoy the Beatles as never before!!! They might have broke up ions ago but the music live on!!! It's groovy baby,Austin Powers would love this!!!Two thumbs up!!! Way Up!!! A+
Example: [Not the same quality as Cave Bear or Valley of Horses] I read "Mammoth Hunters" after "Clan of Cave Bear" and "The Valley of the Horses" hoping to get something similar, but I just found in "Mammoth Hunters" some kind of love & jellousy novel running in prehistoric times. This book is not as fresh, as precedents, it is not as interesting as precedents and it is not as good as precedents. Characters of both "lovers" are not well design, character of Ayla becomes soft and, so to say, wishy-washy, rhythm becomes slow and imagination falls to none. Before reading "Mammoth Hunters" I bought "Plains of Passage", after reading it I have not found courage enough to read "PoP".
Example: [A Steaming Pile of Crap] If there was an option for zero stars, that is what I would award this "book." To point out all of the flaws, inaccuracies, and blatant falsehoods in this book would take up nearly as much space as the book itself occupies. I wholeheartedly agree with a previous reviewer that if one is not intellectualy ready for Liber ABA, then that person is not ready for ceremonial magick. This book panders to idiots and is a disgrace to Crowley's name.
Example: [Foam Sleeve for the shop vacuum cleaner] The sleeve is the perfect fit and worked fine. Mostly, i used it to vacuum wet areas. It is not as strudy as I would like it to be, but, for it's price point it is OK ...
Example: [BRUTAL] What a mess! This game stinky inky inks inks and that is my honest and most friendly opinion of this game. It doesn't even dip into the grand theft auto pool. This is a uneven, unfinished, and unfun game. I WARN YOU ONCE TO STAY AWAY
Example: [Hard to play] This is EASY game??? WOW~!!! This is HARD game for me. WHY? Because it does not let me control the players too well....and players move too slow for how I want them to play. May be I need a manual booklet since I purchased this item solo without manual. I have been playing hundreds of hrs, but never has been able to win any matches. I select 5/5 team against 2/5 team, and I still get beat. It plays with my eye site? I can not see where ball is going to be and whre I need to move players to, etc. I also do not know how to control the PK, or simple shot in the way I want it to go......VERY IRRITATING to play since I can not control the players the way I want them to play........
Example: [Do not order this shovel] I have used this shovel for only two N.Y. snow storms and it is already wearing through. The wear strip is mounted on the inside of the shovel. Thus the bottom of the shovel beneath the metal wear strip is wearing out. This shovel will not last one season. I have other suncast shovels which have the wear strip on both sides of the shovel. These products last longer. The shovel that I recommend is Suncast SC2700 20-Inch Snow Shovel/Pusher Combo with Wear Strip And D-Grip Handle.
Example: [Didn't fit my needs] This product did not fit my need of transporting Lantus and Aphidra pens. The plastic inside was stiff and not convenient for me. I returned it.
Example: [This is about alternate history --- at the meta level --- too rarefied for me] I knew that Niall would talk about alt history, but I was sore disappointed that he didn't describe or excerpt or analyze any specific examples. I knew he would mention alt history --- but I was dismayed to discover he failed to USE it.
Example: [Does Not Work] When I try to build a room on the ship, it crashes my Windows 2000 Computer. Looked at their site for maybe some updates or FAQs, but there are none. This is being returned.
Example: [I bought this book I while back when we were starting a antique bottle collection.] It helps know the value when we can look it up in a book. We don't want to over pay when making bids on line.
Example: [DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT] I was tempted to buy this product as it was reasonably priced and seemed to support what I needed. After I got this product it did not work - the software could not detect the unit on the network. I troubleshooted the problem with IOGEAR technical support and was told that the unit was defective and I should return it. Thinking that this can happen once, I ordered a replacement unit. Guess what? this one did not work as well. The same exact problem - the unit did not get an ip and therefore was not detected. Again customer support and again I was told to return the unit. I am not buying an IOGEAR again.
Example: [GOOD] OKay, when i told my friends I had bought this sailor moon movie, they were all like "Oh, all the other ones are better..." and stuff like that. I thought that this one was really good, but they were right. The other ones are better. that doesn't mean I'm putting this one down or anything. this movie is totally awesome. I loved it. in the end, it made me wanna cry. I mean Luna was awesome... I wished it aws real life. It's kinda is a remake of the Berly seen. I mean come on, the silver crystal again, on to boulder type things, in cold weather... but it was totally great. if you liked this one, go get the others too...
Example: [Good Cables!] I bought these for a project that I was doing and they added the needed length and clarity to my projector that I needed.
Example: [Unreliable PDA phone] I am now on my THIRD Treo 600. The first two were replaced because the phone would turn itself off and back on again, go out of service when calls were being made or received, and losing my programmed data. My third treo is only a week old and is dropping calls constantly. I have been happy with the phone when it works, but, reliability is a serious problem. Verizon Wireless has been no help either other than in replacing the phone under warranty which takes no less than 2 hours of my time and two days to ship. Battery life is less than expected and I'm usually recharging the phone by late afternoon. Another annoying feature is the low battery warning that must be cleared from the screen if you're trying to dial in codes to check voice mail or other dtmf services. It will interrupt you every 10 seconds. Also, the person on the other end can hear your low battery tones, voice mail notifications, etc. Annoying.
Example: [The Streets of Osaka?] This movie projects the come back of the "Streets of San Francisco" of the 70s but the setting is in the city of Osaka, Japan. In this movie, Michael Douglas teamed up with young stud, Andy Garcia, both cops in battling a Japanese syndicate who is involved in counterfeiting money. Packed with action and motorcycle stunts, this movie depicts a difficult alliance with both cultures in battling crime, but in the end comes a common understanding of putting the bad guys behind bars. Subtitles in english is not an option although they are shown when japanese is spoken. nice flick!
Example: [Very funny] I sent this to my son-in-law serving his 2nd tour in Iraq. His comment was that this was a very funny dvd and enjoyed it very much.
Example: [JBuds Earbuds] JBuds Hi-Fi Noise-Reducing Ear Buds (Black)These work as advertised. They are clear in tone and comfortable to wear.
Example: [poor quality, bad spacing on brackets] The sanding on this shelf was poorly done and requires more work. And the brackets are spaced at 28", rather than the 32" that is required to go stud to stud. So with only one screw holding up each side, you can only anchor it in drywall. That means that you can't put much weight on the shelf. Very disappointed...
Example: [Okay...] Well, this book was highly disapointing. I am aHUGE Phantom Phan and I absolutely love Erik, lol- but this book had a terrible portrayal of Erik.I hated how they described Erik. Erik was describedas more evil and selfish rather than loving towardsChristine. He lusted after Christine, rather then loved her. This is definitely not Gaston Leroux's version!I have many Phantom books - this one, I have to say, is myleast favorite!
Example: [In need of this item] My boyfriend is diabetic and he an out before we went on vacation. He usually gets them from the hospital.
Example: [WHAT THE?????] Who are these guys? This has got to be some kind of bad joke! What is the point of this cd? I beg of you don't buy this thing. This is no tribute! In my opinion it sounds like they are mocking Eminem. Just listening to the samples made me wanna puke. Excuse me while I go put cotton in my ears to stop the bleeding!
Example: [Not for Heavy Duty Use] We make a lot of whole grain breads, which typically have a stiffer dough than white bread. We used this machine about twice a week for several months. After noticing that the loaves weren't rising as well as at first, I stayed around in the kitchen and discovered that the motor was laboring and the paddle was barely turning. I made a few loaves of white bread; rising was better, but not as good as at first. One day the machine began making terrible noises and I ended up kneading by hand.Sunbeam replaced the machine, which was still under warranty. I've used the new one to make white bread, with small amounts of corn or oat flour added, with acceptable results. Yesterday I tried a loaf using half whole wheat flour, along with some white and some rye. When the motor began laboring, I stopped the machine and completed by hand.I'm now in the market for a machine with a stronger motor.
Example: [Bad Pair of Shoes] I saw this pair of shoes and thought that they were very cute, however, when they arrived they had smalls stains on over the front of the shoe. Very Very disappointed, I will return the shoes and never order anything from this seller again.
Example: [Great Help] This book is great because it is tabbed for easy reference. It was a great price too. It can be carried with you anywhere. And I love that it spaces to write everything from the propasol to your wedding vows. It includes tips to save money also, without sounding like you're trying to be cheap. It has all the directions for addressing envelopes and reasons behind some old traditions. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because it sounds like it's almost trying to help you plan a very upscale, classy, expensive, almost unrealistic wedding at times. But otherwise it is great. I definately recommend it.
Example: [rev raptor the lamest zoid ever] this model kit stinks it has low move ability lame weapons and no articulation
Example: [THE BEST BOOK ON EARTH!!!!] HI I am 14 years old and have just finshed reading this book. "Out of Harms way" is A MUST for any animal lover. It tells of an amazing AWSOME lady named Terri Crisp also author. This book just amazes me at how much this women did with her liufe and how full it must feel to her. to keep it short though all i am going to say is YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is worth its weight in gold. when you open this book you can't put it down and each page will keep you intersted and amaze you even more than the page before. so READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!
Example: [Card is (probably) great, seller is ......not. $7 to ship???] Still haven't received my order yet because they sent it to somewhere in Washington, which would be fine if I didn't give a shipping address in Florida. After four days, I still have no response to my email from the third party seller, which is apparently located in rural Kazakhstan judging by what they charge to send it to you. Seven bucks for what must be among the smallest, lightest items on the entire Amazon site? Come on...
Example: [Amazing book that left me deeply moved] This is one of the best books I have read in a long time. It is a simple story of mistakes and cover-ups that haunt a family for a lifetime. The quality of writing is stellar. The scenes and emotions are so vivid that I felt that I was almost there as this family's story unfolded. I felt like I was made to see the story of this family's pain through many different prisms and lenses (just like in real families) and each one of those views left an imprint inside me and moved me. It is a truly remarkable book, and I will remember it for a long time to come. I read the book over a brutal 40 hour journey (many delays and flight cancellations) but I remained largely oblivious to it all. The book had transported me to another world.... I will read everything Kim Edwards writes! Looking forward to the next book!
Example: [A slight, nearly perfect memoir...] A rare glimpse inside the mind of one of America's greatest novelists and screenwriters. It is both fun and rewarding to learn what goes on behind the scenes in the movie industry and what goes into a novel as complex as The Cider House Rules.Mr. Irving is in a position to be entirely subjective - he's earned this forum and he uses it to his advantage. This is a book of opinion and nowhere does the author hold back.If you care at all about what goes into the maknig of a top quality movie and what goes on inside the mind of one of our best, pick up My Movie Business.
Example: [very nice planer] I picked up this planer in August and have since used it several times preparing wood for many projects. As advertised, it is very heavy and takes a number of hours to set up. Once the machine is assembled and adjusted, it does a wonderful job planing woods. It must be used with a dust collection unit as you will soon be in a mountain of chips! The two speeds are nice - you can buzz through a pile of wood in short order and then finish the boards on the slower setting - although with sharp blades, it is difficult to improve on the finish at the faster setting. The maching and parts were nearly flawless - the only fault I have observed is that one of the screws that fastend the oil gear box leaks a small amount of oil.My experience is that this is a very good quality machine.Bob
Example: [Paramount apparently doesn't want my money...] My wife has had this title pre-ordered for well over a month. I guess they don't want to do business with us.I think I'll avoid all Paramount titles from now on.
Example: [Pretty Lame] Yeah, they died. They all died. The old salt had warned them the berries were poison and to never eat them. The toddler ate them first - then mom and dad decided to eat some to - so they could all go together.Now a sequel where the toddler who ate the poisonous berries DIDN'T die.Boo!
Example: [Juice Master] Very pleased with this....have started the turbo charge my life programme...thank you - far cheaper than buying locally!
Example: [If you want Bologna, look no further] The story is true, but exaggerated and important parts left out.Under the Banner of Heaven is a fictional account for faiths that would like to bash the Mormons.
Example: [Why no "Ties Your Mother Down"] It's beyond me how some knucklehead can put together a 3 disc Queen "greatest hits" and leave off "Tie Your Mother Down." If I'd been paying attention I probably would not have bought this. Now you know...
Example: [Funny and poignant] Millie Crisswell's books have always kept me entertained. The Wedding Planner is very humorous, but also very poignant. This is a book to curl up in front of the fire with--or to read on the beach--or in the bathtub!
Example: [A real page turner] I caught an interview on Larry King with a few of the principals of the expedition, and I knew I had to read this book. The horible outcome of the expedition aside, Krakauer does a spectacular job of describing the ascent to the top and, if the story had ended there, would have been a very interesting account of high altitude climbing. Though, the description of the resulting tragedy was a little less clear than I would have liked, the story was gripping and unforgetable. True, there were a lot of names thrown around, but the "Who's Who" at the beginning made this much more managable. This is great reading and nearly impossible to put down.
Example: [More than just nostalgia] Hank Halio manages to convey the old stories from Sephardic Turkey and 'dahntown' New York City with a warmth and affection that brings them to life and makes them as entertaining now as they were then. Moreover, anyone wanting to brush up on their Ladino, or in my case, learn more than I knew from home, has a great primer here, with a glossary, conversations (and translations), sayings, and so much more. It is a very, very good book, and I only wish there were a sequel.
Example: [good but not very good] some interesting library and book shelf layouts but i feel the author didn't go as far as could and should have. i subscribe to many home periodicals and have seen so much more in those than with this one book devoted entirely to physical book display. good book but at price definately top retail.
Example: [Stan Helsing] Stan Helsing is like A Bad Modern Day SNL Skit(Yes SNL Has not been good In Years). Put in Somebody Unfunny like Thompson From Unfunny SNL,And the other twits in the cast with the Exception of Leslie Nielsen and you have a Mediocre Movie at best from The Catholic Priest/Altar Boy Jokes to the bad costumes of the "Monsters". I wish they would Stop Milking Scary Movie(the First 3 or 4 were Funny).
Example: [Durable, reliable, reasonably fast, cheap -- good bargain] I've had this HDD for about 3.5 years now, and have had no problems with it at all. It's durable (I've been carrying it around it backpacks and riding bicycles with it, etc.), reliable, and reasonably fast for data transfer to/from another drive (although moving files on the drive itself is a bit slow).There are of course, larger faster smaller drives out there, but this one is a good bargain -- if this one meets your requirements, I think you'll be satisfied for the price.
Example: [Five stars for this?] I am a young adult librarian- and I am stunned this book does not have any negative reviews. This book has a laundry list of inexcusable issues: the character of the mother is as one-dimensional as they come, the dialogue is laughable, the resolution of the story is so implausible and unbelievable. The protaganist fights back against lies, stalking, and peeping toms- by lying, stalking, and turning into a peeping tom. It's all just nauseating trash.
Example: [Great expectations, poor presentation] The only good thing I can say about this product besides the aggressive advertising effort, is that it has the perfect size cup for a single serve drink.As I was happily putting my protein drink together, I turned it over to start blending. All I heard was a whirring sound.When I removed the cup - I saw that the driver bit - the part the turns the blades around was all worn out and busted.All these cups and serving pitchers, and colored lids, and cups and all the accessories - was worth nothing.I cant recommend this product - it has a very limited life span. Less than a year if you use it 3-4x a week.Won't buy it again.
Example: [Teen's Review] I didn't like this book so much because American Girl has a tactful way of wording things. You'd think this is a good thing, but it's really not, becuase most of the book suggests being a good friend, but what if your friend is the one that's complicating things? If you have a specific relationship with a friend that's not working out, this book will help you out somewhat, but won't answer your specific concerns.
Example: [Simple but effective] High praise for the Vega fence. It is simple to install (30 minutes)and works great. Needed to file a couple holes a little bigger for height adjustment. It glides smoothly, locks positively with little effort, is easy to remove and love the micro adjustment. When I up date my saw, I'm keeping the Vega fence.
Example: [Overrated to the extremus] I saw this movie in a theater in January of 1984, and if I never see it again for the rest of my life, I'll be a happy man. My loathing for this film knows no bounds. It's perhaps the most un-worthy film to ever be awarded the "Best Picture" Oscar, beating out much better candidates like "The Right Stuff" and "The Big Chill" that were nominated that year. As I was watching it, I kept saying to myself "When does this get better?" It never did, not once over its achingly long 131 minute running time. My former co-worker called this "the movie where the mother and daughter talk on the telephone all the time." Which it is. Throw in some infidelity and an incurable disease, and that summarizes this piece of nonsense on celluloid. Avoid this movie at all costs.A few months back, I actually tried to watch this on TV, to see if my opinion had changed over the years. Well, it did. I hated this movie even more. I didn't think that was possible.
Example: ["Nine" on the ten scale.] This is the new album from Nine Inch Nails. Just Kidding. "Pretty Hate Machine" was originally released in 1989, and did for industrial music what "Nevermind" did for grunge. Much of the success of this debut came because of the time of release (the beginning of the alt-revolution), as well as it's appeal to metal-heads, goths, punks, and alternative types in general. If the masses couldn't handle Skinny Puppy, they could handle NIN. Many would call this industrial-pop, but regardless of how you classify it, it's extremely good. "Head Like A Hole" is still one of their best songs, and my favorite "Down In It" and "Sin" were also popular singles. However, some of the other tracks are what really make this disc, underrated cuts like "The Only Time", "Ringfinger", and the moody "Something I Can Never Have". Overall, I do believe that 1994's "The Downward Spiral" is the one essential NIN album, but saying that "Pretty Hate Machine" is no good is simply a "Terrible Lie".
Example: [Bad music] This CD is the worst CD i've ever heard in my life. Mainly because the songs(remixes) are so dumb-sounding. I would rather listen to ten hours of somebody scratching their fingernails across a chalkboard than to hear this CD.
Example: [Would be a five with a few additions] It can take the weight and operates smoothly. After a very short period of usage I got comfortable with the controls. I would have liked two improvements 1. it does not have a level bubble - solved by buying a bubble that attached to the flash shoe 2. the base is not calibrated which helps in panaromic photos. I have used it for macro and telephoto shots as well as general landscape shots and am very satisified
Example: [An Enjoyable Version of The Classic Story] This film is pretty good. The animals looked great. This story has always been a cute but very sad one. I really prefer the animated version better. Maybe it's just because that's the version I saw as a child. I didn't think Julia Roberts was a good pick for Charlotte. Her voice is so mono-tone and the original Charlotte had a pretty voice. Overall I still highly suggest you see this version.
Example: [Biased Drivel] Hmmmm. A book on biased reporting by someone with an overwhelming and obvious bias. With "Alice in Wonderland" logic and little factual support, the reader gets the point of this dreary book very quickly. Wouldn't convince a child of the author's point, but might stoke people predisposed to the author's conspiracy views.
Example: [magnalite] Excellent cookware I'm going to purchase more later. It is easy to clean and very little sticks to the pans
Example: [Fantastic after correct setup] These earbuds are great but you have to set them up correctly. First, they have to be put into your ear canal not just hanging in your ear. Second, you must use the correct size rubber earbud cover. I initially used the smallest sized ear bud cover because it fit in easily but I was a bit frustrated with the weak bass. After switching to the medium earbud cover the bass was absolutely fantastic. I recommend these 100% and they are infinitely better than standard Apple earbuds. I suggest trying the earbuds on first with the small black earbud cover to get used to inserting them into your ear; then use the mediums for incredible sound.
Example: [Great! Love her relaxed personality!] I have an extensive library of yoga videos and this one is probably going to become one of my favorites! It's only 45 minutes long, but I feel great afterward -- love that there are modifications for every level -- I'm flexible in some ways but not in others so I can pick who I should follow based on how I'm feeling. Love that it's an athletic but not too new-agey (similar to the Sara Ivanhoe videos -- which are also my favorites). Definitely recommended to add to anyone's in home yoga practice.
Example: [Stopped working after a few hours!] It seemed really nice at first - thought it was a great buy. After several hours, it just stopped. No jam... just wouldn't respond. Returned it and got the Porter-Cable US58. It costs 3 times as much but it works great!
Example: [inside the woman and the man.] The thing that stirkes me more than anything in this book is the sad realization of the fact that very light things(like crossing a certain border) could bring down heavy consequences. Consequences that would shape ourlives and hence ourselves in a drastically different way. All over the story the inside of the man and the woman performed the same torturing dance. But only inside the heavy she became certain that he loved her. She was happy to know that he really did(happinees is light) and she was sad(heavy) to see him the victim of the proof. Milan Kundera flips the coin of heavy and light showing us different faces (of many different dark colors) for the same two sides of his coin until all the faces blend. He is a true magician.
Example: [Really?] Well, as live shows go...this would be a "2" with some "6" around the middle and heading back to "2" through the end.Jani wasn't even trying to sing through most of this, not even trying...and we all know that you don't listen to Warrant because of the irreplaceable band members right?Bummer. Crossing my fingers that the rest of my Warrant selections come in and sound great. This one, uh, not so much folks.
Example: [Underland Review] This book was well written but it was not my style of book. I really like the author. I would recommend this book to anyone.
Example: [Harry Connick, crooner for the 21st century.] This CD is a nice collection of christmas songs. He does "sleigh Ride" with a nice swing beat and it makes this CD! I think he is a very underrated musician that deserves more attention.
Example: [The PS2 is really good!] This is the most futuristic gaming system available! The games are the best! I own a N64 but the PS2 is better by a mile! I would reccomend it to anyone!
Example: [Not worth it] Just buy a clear windtunnel and the whisper fans because with the fans you can't tell that the LEDs are really working because of the fan LEDs and would save you some money
Example: [Terrific tool for the harried parents of a newborn.] This book turned out to be very handy when I had my twins! My girls were on different schedules and I was so exhausted I couldn't remember who had eaten or slept. I started keeping notes so I could see if there were any patterns, and work towards getting them on the same nap schedule. The only downside is that it is designed for one baby, so I had to find a way to notate both babies on one page. I went through two copies which now serve as a reminder that yes, it really was as nutty as I remembered! I have since given this as a gift. What's more you can often find it here on Amazon at a very good price.
Example: [Metallic Emo Kids Provide Riff Therapy] Thrice melds Brobdingnagian riffs with melodic hooks, complex song structures, and socially aware lyrics: all elements combine to form a spitfire of a record. The record commences with a trifecta, each song flowing and segueing into another. The single "All That's Left" is justified but falls short of the dazzling title track, a pitch-perfect synthesis of pop and metal. Not to mention that the lyrics are rife with optimism and a fresh outlook, ideas not usually evoked in this genre. "Paper Tigers" is all throat tearing screams punctuated by stacatto guitar, a typical hardcore jaunt and the likely supect for weakest track. It could be said that some of the songs sound like duplicates. Nevermind that. Just concentrate on your thundering heart and sweaty palms.
Example: [Neat design] THe Hakuba FP-L1 is a nifty, small, mini tripod! The all metal construction seems very sturdy and well-put-together. It also has a key-turn nut for the camera screw which is very easy to use. Also, the adjustable camera platform "clicks" into several pre-set positions which is handy as well! It folds into a very small footprint which will fit into the smallest of camera bags. Note, however, that the tripod does not have a horizontal swivel head on it like I had hoped. It just has a vertical adjustment. This tripod would be great for macro work or simple travel setups.
Example: [Thinkpad T40 good battery] I wolud like to know how much time to charge it before use it first time and the better way to take care of the battery.Thank you.Marianela
Example: [22% of The Old Testament] I've recently started a new study of the prophets in the bibleand came across some books in my library that I have treasuredfor a few years. This book has some deep commentary about thefour major prophets of the Old Testament. Jeremiah and Lamentations,Isaiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel. Also in this volume of the O.T. Surveyseries is complete with Maps, Charts and Diagrams.If you're studying the Word for insight, perhaps Eschatology oreven some Soteriology I think you'll find this book a good selectionfor review.It's a library keeper for me, which means a good reference book.hope this helps you!
Example: [Not worth to make a DVD out of it] I would not say it the way others do in reviews, an orchestra that is not from german speaking soil can shure play Bruckner as good as a Berlin Philarmonic. The problem with this orchestra from Israel is that it simply is not a top level orchestra. When I hear the many missed tones from the brass section (the wagner tubas even miss the tones in the first measures) and the bad pitch of the strings, I would say for an amateur-village-orchestra they play pretty good. The conductor swings his lower jaw around it seems he could loose it any moment. His conducting is very theatralic, I dont understand much about conducting but he does not make a good impression.
Example: [I have my summer back] I know this particular cleaner is intended for above-ground pools but at the price I was willing to risk it with our in-ground. Wanda does a great job even in our in-ground. It struggled getting out of the deep end at first but that turned out to be because our filter needed maintenance and was not providing the suction needed. I sorted that out and now it wanders through out the entire pool. I need to manually clean the sides and occasionally sweep the corners near the steps but this is a great starter cleaner it is already giving me back my summer to enjoy our pool. With two children I am over the top about a clean pool. We have many trees in our yard and this lead to cleaning the pool almost every day. Now I can just drop Wanda in the pool and let it go while I can do other things. I may upgrade to one intended for a in-ground pool but I am going to see how long this one lasts.
Example: [Best christmas cd ever] I have listened to this cd every Christmas for the last 20 years. The songs have touched my heart everytime I listen to them. The track "One Small Child", being my favorite, has nearly worn away (if that can happen to a cd). Aretha Franklin'strack of What Child Is This is most unique. I would recommend this cd to anyone who celebrates Christmas.
Example: [STEAM? Where? Cold water, occasionally tempid] I am so disappointed with this product. I am embarrassed to say how much I paid for it two years ago. I bought it based on its ratings here. Big Mistake!I recently attempted to use the hand attachments to clean my chairs. WHAT A MESS!! The hand attachment sprays all over the place. In order to get WARM water, you have to hold down the water spray button for several seconds, leaving your chair cushion saturated, and your floor wet!Hoover should be ashamed calling this a STEAM vac! Its down right misleading. What a waste of money.
Example: [Good Choice] I am relatively new to the world of home exercise, with the exception of a few TaeBo videos. I bought this DVD because my thighs have always been a major problem area, and after doing the video twice am very impressed. The exercises are explained well and very easy to do- its the repetitions that kick my butt! The models are a little lifeless, but their physique is definite motivation. Overall, this DVD was worth my money.
Example: [Bloodsucking friends] My son (15) and I have now both read this book (I have started 'you suck', and the boy is badgering me every day to get me to finish it so he can have it). It's a great anti-twilight; very funny, quite gritty and yet you still feel compassion for the characters.
Example: [Boring] I'm going to have to disagree with the majority of the reviews on this movie. I have seen plenty of Russian films, and many of them have been slow and entirely reliant upon the emotional component. Mikhalkov, for example, is a director who can do this. This movie suffers from pretentious screenwriting, and a lack of underlying meaning or moral lesson. although the acting isn't necessarily bad, you don't get attached to the characters. I got the feeling that the cinematography and the colors didn't match the movie's theme and plot. At times it got so boring that i wanted to stop watching, even though i never do that. Anyway, I do not recommend this movie. IF you want to watch some good russian movies, go with "Brother", "Burnt By The Sun", "Prisoner of THe Mountains", "War", or "Unfinished Piece for the Mechanical Piano"
Example: [Primordial] I know Tangerine Dream's music since 1976. I liked PHAEDRA, RUBYCON, RICOCHET, and the first and last composition of their live album ENCORE. I also like some of their film music, especially the soundtrack for Friedkin's SORCERER. Now I bought ZEIT and realize one thing. The earlier their music, the better. With STRATOSFEAR it became commercial and went downhill from there. ZEIT allows you to enter a different world, another dimension almost. It's perfect meditation music, not like that cheap new age crap, but rich and moody experimental music. It sometimes makes me think of the FORBIDDEN PLANET score. Can't wait to hear ALPHA CENTAURI & ATEM. Simply amazing!
Example: [Poor range for me.] Does not compare with Motorola. The range was poor. Interestingly, when I pressed the call button, that was transmitted but the recipient couldn't pick up my voice and vice versa. If they work for you, then you have a good deal. But not for me.
