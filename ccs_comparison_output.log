Example: [Fantasy and Science Fiction; What's better!?] This is one of Anthony's more serious works when compared to the Xanth puns. The book--the series in fact--has the essence of both Sci-Fi AND Fantasy blended together in a cohesive work that should delight both the AD&D players and the Trekkers
Example: [A little too convenient] This was my first Jo Beverly novel and it wasn't bad. I liked the heroine Susan, she made mistakes, but didn't consider herself a tragic heroine. Con was okay. A little dense. Where I had problems were some of the "twists" in the plot. I thought they were a little too tidy. I also thought the inclusion of the Georges and the Rogues were unnecessary at the end. Like I said, not a bad book, but not really a keeper either.
Example: [Too complex and not very fun] After 90 minutes of play and no sight of an end we gave up. Got old very fast. I am a huge Jeff Foxworthy fan but this game was way to complex for a redneck like me.. Don't waste your money on this one.
Example: [Darth Vader still #1!] No way in the world can I believe that Xixor is as smart and cunning as Darth or Jabba. There was not enough space action or blaster showdowns as it should have. Dash Rander was okay... Xixor and Guri just plain sucked. Mr. Perry took way to many chances throughout the book to build them up for nothing. I hope they both died and never come back. As far as Darth Vader's equal, PLEASE. Not on even. Vader has been around for decades, and all of a sudden I'm supposed to think Xixor is just as ruthless? Nope. I was tricked by the bestseller thing at the top of the book. No more.
Example: [Shoddy Customer Service] I can't review this product fully because it was missing parts when it arrived. So I have not been able to fully assemble the unit. I called Valley's customer service department and the person on the phone seemed sure that all the parts were there and that I just didn't know what I was talking about. After going back and forth for fifteen minutes he finally agreed that a part was missing and took down my information. It has been one month to the day that I placed the order and I still have not received the part. I've made numerous attempts to call them by phone and I get voicemail every time. I also sent an email that has not been answered either.
Example: [Breathtaking!! A powerful story of love and betrayal] I couldn't put this one down. This is the first time I've read Teresa Medeiros,and it won't be the last!!Ms Medeiros takes you deep into the story with her captivating use of words. You feel every emotion the characters go through. This story left me breathless.
Example: [Testament] I am grateful for the witness that believing Christians can obtain and strengthen from this additional Testament of Jesus Christ.Nephi, Alma, Mormon and Moroni all become new witnesses along side Peter, Paul and John. The additional account of Jesus' ministry in the Americas after His resurrection is a calming, reaffirming credential to the truth of His life and mission, both mortal and immortal.
Example: [Very disappointing Jack White group work] Huge Jack White and White Stripes fan, but this has nothing worthy of discussing. Their other album would be a better choice to start with.
Example: [Stretching for Seniors] I was disappointed in this video. Although she is in very good shape for an older person I didn't feel any energy from her. I wanted more stretches, not ballet.
Example: [Memorial Day is outstanding] I've recently purchased all of Vince Flynn's previous books in paperback so I could read everything he has written in sequence. Memorial Day is another outstandingly written book in the Mitch Rapp series.
Example: [5 Years ago...] I bought this saucepan back in 2005 from amazon.com and has been using it frequently to cook all kinds of food (mainly soup and stir-fry dishes). This pan is heavy, build to last and quite versatile. I highly recommend it :) Still one of my favorite pan after all these years...
Example: [NOT a DVD] Please be aware that this is not a DVD for use in a DVD player. It is a disc made only for the "Read with Me DVD Learning System". This was not clear in the item description and my daughter was in tears when her birthday present wouldn't work. I felt really bad for her and feel mislead.
Example: [Great for casserole storage] I have had a baking dish w/lid like this for years. I got online to see if I could find another as I use it constantly. It's great for casseroles as left overs are easily stored in same dish they were cooked in. I make meatloaf up ahead of time and put them in the freezer in this dish to pull out in a week or two. I love it!I have a suggestion for the person making a cake - use smaller cake mixes or brownies - then the icing isn't tall enough to stick :)
Example: [This is not a beginner's book, I know I am a programmer.] I wasted my money on this book. It says it is a beginner book;but it is definitly not!!! Sorry, but I would like to give ita good rating, but I just can't. In the first few pages itjumps in to complexity. I read more to see if it was gettingbetter, but it got worse. I did find a good book for begginer's.They are out there. I am surprised that the preface for this saysit is for beginner's. Number 1 best seller? Maybe I should writea book then!! This book is a reference book, not a beginner's!Trust me. I could go on and on, but if you are a beginner, all I can say is do not get it.
Example: [My Book Review] This book was required for my CULA 101 class and i found it very hard to understand some of the terms used in the text. I know the book was translated from french to english, nut i feel that the book is on a level that on professionals of the highest ranking can understand. I would hate to say it, but if you "dummy down" the book, i am sure more people would be able to understand it.
Example: [Time Machine] A pleasing variety of Swing tunes that will bring you back to the 1940s in no time at all.
Example: [A good give-away] Reminds me of the stuff we used to see on Saturday afternoon back in the 40's and 50's - I gave mine away.
Example: [This book is painfully bad] Read 3/4 of the book and stopped. I don't know why the author even attempted to write this book or how it even got published. He seems to take pride in being a maverick and general goofball. The author did nail the title though. Save your money....
Example: [peace] While I was recovering from a horrible tragedy I was given this CD from a friend. I listened to it just about every hour I was awake for months. It really brought me peace and helped me to heal. I have since used it as a gift to others that are suffering.
Example: [Junk] The lid on the cup broke within 5 uses despite the cup being only half filled with grounds. Unfortunately, I cannot return it. Furthermore, this device made a horrible cup of coffee. I tried various grind consistencies but each cup was extremely weak. You could actually watch the "coffee" coming out of the Keurig clear. Lastly, this cup leaked the water/coffee all over the counter and machine. What a joke. Keurig should be ashamed.
Example: [Amazon needs a negative star rating for this...] Say what you will about whatever you consider the worst film ever made...mutiply it by about 7 and you come pretty close to this garbage. I actually bought this (used at a video store) because it was the last film appearance by James Doohan (Star Trek's Scotty). Not only was it sad to see him so far gone but for it to be in this swill is just gut-wrenching.I won't even attempt to actually review this...just stay very far away. Even the Mystery Science Theater 3000 guys wouldn't touch this one.
Example: [Good Nail/Hair Vitamins] was having a problem with nails not growing and decided to try these......have to say they work cause now after a few short months my nails (and hair) are growing like weeds!!!!
Example: [Wow, this is great] My dog loves this water dog. At first he was a little hesitant with the clicking noise this makes when it senses the dog or something else near, but I trained him to ignore the noise. Now all I say is go get water and he goes over and gets his water. When he is in the yard by himself he will go over and get water without an issue. I really like the fact that he has fresh clean water whenever he wants it and I am not filling water bowls outside all the time. Great Product!
Example: [Nice Novel] Anyone who thinks this is anything other than a book version of National Enquirer has a short-circuit in his or her B.S. detector. I'm not saying that some strange things didn't happen, but the telling of this story is just that-- a story, meant to entertain, garner attention, and make money, and I'm sure they have succeeded at all three. Please, don't be so gullible people. It's ok to be a believer, but be smart and discerning about what you believe. If you want a for-instance, read Witness to Roswell, and compare the quality of writing, research, and documentation to this garbage. That will give you a standard by which to judge.
Example: [Pathetic] As a 20 year player of Dungeons and Dragons, I have to say that this movie is one of the worst ones I've seen in my entire life. The only entertainment value in it is laughing at just how bad the acting, dialogue, and story is. ...wait for Lord of the Rings to come out this winter.
Example: [NOT as shown] Item is NOT as shown on you on-Line advertisement! There it is shown as a complete tailgate locking system including the handle not as received consisting of only the Bezel, lock and two key! I consider this fraudulent method of advertising and do expect to be credited the full amount of purchase, shipping and the additional cost of the return shipment! returned 12 days ago still waiting refund
Example: [Terrible for skiing goggles] I have eye contacts and need an airtight fit -- these will NOT provide that because the magnet is not nearly strong enough to keep the goggles fastened under decent tension.
Example: [crap] i paid [...] bucks for tyhis gun got it and got it ready and figured out how it worksand after using it a few time si relized its flawsfirst its too damn smallits accurcy is not bad but its velocity is utter crapand doenst do squat in heavy battlesand the clip is a reduiclus system of shaking the rounds form teh clips into the spring ssystembuy this for collections and maybe for soem fun but not a good gun and it jammed after the first month and i broke it trying to fix it
Example: [Perfect for falling asleep] This CD puts me to sleep -- which is a good thing. In addition to the babbling water, there are bird and other forest sounds, but nothing is too loud or jarring. I put this in my CD player, press 'repeat' and drift away. If you share a house with snorers, it's either environmental recordings like this one or earplugs!
Example: [Very disappointed] When I bought this flight simulator I was told since I had a brand new computer that was more than powerfull enough that I would really enjoy this thing. Well I guess they lied. You probably have to spend $5,000 on a computer to run this thing and get all the effects that were put into it. I can either get great graphics with a really bad flight or a great flight with practically no graphics at all but not both. When I called Microsoft, the woman I spoke to in India could barely speak English and she didn't seem to have a clue about what my problem was.
Example: [Great shredder + flimsy bucket = total disappointment] The top portion, the shredder itself, is very well designed, but the bucket is made of a flimsy plastic that is hardly able to hold the heavy top. If I could rate the parts separately, I would give 5 stars for the top and -3 points for the bucket. If it was not for the desperate desire to cut manufacturing costs [Fellowes, why not to try using a paper bucket next?], it could have been a great shredder. Unfortunately, the product overall is not worth its shipping price, not to mention the $100+ price tag.
Example: [The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle] We thoroughly enjoyed this book. It captivates you from the very beginning. This book uses great imagery and descriptive language. We felt that the book made us feel as if we were on the ship with Charlotte. Every aspect of that book reached out to us. We feel that this would be a great book to use in the classroom. The descriptive language is wonderful and would be an excellent example to use when teaching this concept. We feel that this book would be beneficial for 5-7th Grade. Once again we really enjoyed reading this book.
Example: [Misled!] Do not buy this single if you are looking for the ballad version of Alive. Silly me, I must have missed when it was clearly stated that the version here was an uptempo one when I ordered it from Amazon, and only got suspicious when the CD arrived and I looked at the back. I'm not a great fan of J-Lo's singing but I do like the ballad version of Alive. However, there is no way I will be buying the remixes CD- what was she thinking putting a ballad on that CD! I guess I will have to enjoy it on radio.
Example: [I'm Keith Ferrazzi, the most important person in the history of the universe!!] Keith Ferrazzi thinks he's SOOOO COOOLLL!!
Example: [Nice for the price] Good product, was concerned before purchase based on other reviews. I had no problem with assembly. on the first couple of uses the mounting bracket seemed to turn on the seat post but then I realized it was the seat post itself that was turning. Tightened its bolt and everything is working fine.
Example: [Escaflowne the series] The first Escaflowne I experienced was the movie (Which was great). Then I read the comic book series (And that was awesome!!!). Then I saw the series and sank.... I was expecting the same action packed storyline with twists and cool characters as the comic books. But it seems that the anime series was the prototype for the real story. Not only does the anime series and comic book series have different views on what the characters look like, but it is missing some of the great twists and events that the comic book storyline has in it. Then I realized that the comic book was made AFTER the series instead of BEFORE.I believe that the anime series not only has some of the worst animation I have ever seen, but definitaly the worst voice acting I have ever heard (English Audio).If you really want the GOOD Escaflowne experience instead of the AVERAGE one, Watch the movie then read the comic books and totally ignore the TV series. In other words, Don't waste your time watching it.
Example: [Mediocre at best.] First the good news: the actual writing isn't bad, in terms of technical competence. The characters were mostly handled well, both in terms of dialogue and interaction; Major Kira was a bit too hostile, but that was fairly standard for this early in the series, and Odo displayed a variety of intelligence that I don't expect to see from him, but otherwise the book was well enough written to make two separate fairly uninteresting plots passably readable.But that's the bad news: the story behind the writing just wasn't interesting; it's a bad sign when the poker tournament at Quark's is more interesting than the obligatory station crisis.This book was actually written as a collaborative effort between Dean Wesley Smith and his wife, Kristine Katheryn Rush. (Sandy Schofield is the pseudonym they chose for the collaboration.) If you are familiar with (and fond of) the individual work of either of these writers, you might want to try this one. But I can't say that I was overly impressed.
Example: [Hot Tub Time Machine] I was sure this movie was going to be stupid, and I falsely believed that all the funny parts were shown in the commercials. I was so wrong. This movie is actually funnier than The Hangover! I'm going to watch it again as soon as it comes out on DVD.
Example: [Disgusting work] I hated this film. It was long, and didn't make sense. It tried to scare people, but it was more pathetic than scary. I don't think I even got a little bit scared in this film. This is the worst movie in the Jurassic Park Francise.
Example: [Charger killed my phone] I bought this charger for my LG CU500. After less than 30 minutes of charging, it killed my phone. I tried resetting my phone, took the battery out and put it back in, but nothing helps. My phone is dead. There is no response to my email from the company, overall this stands as one my worst online shopping experiences
Example: [poor choice of bilge pumps] sounds good on paper does not function automatically. If you want peace of mind use traditional float switch for auto function. Gradys was the only positive part of this purchase.
Example: [Used MS Money program] Couldn't use it : unsuitability with my computer leading to irreparable (at reasonable cost with no guarantee of result) password problem.
Example: [Same old song] I found this book lame and passe. The views expressed have seen print in seeming thousands of self-help books that came before. The story itself derivative of classic folklore including Paul Bunyan and John Henry. Just as the book suggests leadership cannot be found in a small pill or encapsulated in The Leadership Pill's pages. If you want to read about leadership invest your time reading about great leaders and judge their actions for yourself.
Example: [pains me to write this] i love to read erotica. and i've enjoyed other collections edited by marcy sheiner. but this book is such a disappointment. the stories are mostly fine stories. but i don't buy collections of erotica for "a" story. usually women's erotica offers stories that are exciting from psychological, intellectual, and sexual angles. sadly, most of the stories in this book have none of these qualities to offer.
Example: [flat] this disc is very flat.i saw it coming when Too Short got down with Jermaine Dupri.this album is nothing but a Commercial Project.it's a sad day when an Artist that has defied the Industry and done his own thing stoops to this Level.he has lost his edge&flow.
Example: [Not thrilled] This is a strange instrumental reworking of the songs from Ram. I bought it because in general I'm a Macca fan and wanted to 'complete' my collection.The reworkings are interesting only for curiosity's sake. The album I think was put together by him on a whimsical notion - hence it was never released under his name.Not worth getting unless you desire the whole set of Macca's works
Example: [Buyer beware!] This is the first time I feel strongly enough about a product to write a review. I bought it at Lowes and used it for roughly 2 years before it became completely useless. During the time it was useful, it wasn't necessarily smooth running. Sometimes it worked well, other times it seemed out of balance and lacking in power. As of last year (2007), it is useless. If (BIG IF) it starts, it idles very roughly and dies when any attempt is made to speed it up. Impossible to use. I tried higher quality fuel; I've taken the carb apart thoroughly cleaning it; I've checked the spark; etc. Nothing helps. I've also discovered through searching the Internet that others have had similar and other problems.It could be that I was spoiled by the Craftsman trimmer I had for eight years. I bought it used for $50 and it was still working well when I gave it away.Don't waste your money on this Troy-Bilt trimmer!
Example: [Great read] As a Beatles fan and a lover of things of this nature(weird true tales) I loved this book. It was so fun to realize how easily America runs with a sensational piece of crazy journalism and treats it as a topic for 11 o'clock newscasts. As a film student I see this book as wonderful material for a film, hopefully done bt me.
Example: [Disappointing] This GBA game is quite challenging, but that's not my problem with it. The problem is the graphics is low-quality and the levels very repetitive. There's very little to do other than shooting your way around, and all the soldier enemies look the same. The tiny dots that make up the enemies make it difficult to aim and shoot, so the challenge frequently turns into frustration. All this is not helped by rather poor sound effects. I do not recommend this FPS, at least not for purchase at the current high price. I hate myself for falling for the James Bond license and wasting $30.
Example: [First Rate Jam] If you like melodic and jamming jazz, you'll love this concert. The Amazon review misses the point when it says the problem is in the material and they bemoan the "jamming" --- what do they expect, structured chamber music?? Whether playing old or new material, the beauty of the jamming is in the execution, and this ensemble of musicians do a fine job of presenting a variety of material (which jams) in a very well-paced, entertaining show...that is, for anyone who loves up-tempo melodic jazz.
Example: [Quirky, mystical] This album is great for many reasons, none of them terribly formulaic. Once again Morrison has chosen to experiment with different musical forms and the result is an excellent, albiet quirky, album. The most memorable parts of the album are "So Quiet in Here" and the beautifully joyful song "In the days before Rock n' Roll." Van's voice sounds amazing throughout the album.
Example: [Models from past cycles] The season is pretty good. It is very cool because they are models from the past cycles. Watch the cycle! At first I thought I wasn't going to enjoy it but I did! I still did like the past normal cycles better thought thats why I gave it 4 stars.Thank YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Example: [A+] Good puck arrived exactly as expected. I have used these pucks and they do the job quite well. Hopefully I won't have to put them to the test again.
Example: [Kind of lame] Not very challenging and not the most clever of rules. I don't really see the interest and neither did my children. Maybe 1-3 year olds would find it fun, but not older. The rules don't match up to how the game proceeds, they don't make good sense, just kind of lame and definitely run of the mill game.
Example: [LOVE THESE SPOONS] Perfect size. I have some for some spices that I use in my cooking. I also have a 2 year old. I use these spoons for some baby food etc. Perfect size I love these I am ordering more.
Example: [The Happening] The Happening really fools you into believing this movie will be great. From the beginning to the end, this movie fails to deliver. There are some things in nature that we will never understand/comprehend. This movie has no real answers, no real twists and was overall unbelievable which is not much fun.
Example: [I was up and running with Fortran in 5 hours] I needed to learn Fortran quickly and this book helped me to do it in 5 hours flat. Just type in all the worked out examples and you are on your way. The book is also a good reference.
Example: [Excellent Product] Very easy to use and set-up. Got it working in less than 10 mins! Slightly on the expensive side, but the modem's range and reliability more than make up for the extra cost!!
Example: [good stuff] All good except that it can't consider the lights coming from side face which sometimes would cause a bad affection to your sight.
Example: [Awkward... why not keep it simple?] A small simple keyboard demands a small simple case. This is **NOT** it. The two pockets with Velcro closures should have been omitted. The whole idea of a PDA is that it can be put in a pocket where it's always handy -- and a keyboard (slim to start with) is the kind of thing that should fit into tiny crevices, much like a paperback book slides into a briefcase. The goofy pockets catch on everything, and make the case almost twice as thick. Also notice that they both face in the SAME direction. It is especially hard to put rigid items in the 'blind' pocket -- and to get them out -- unless the GoType has already been removed from the main compartment. I have thought about carefully cutting the pockets enirely off the case, but I have hesitated to do so... it seems such a drastic solution... -- This is a classic case of overdesign with inadequate forethought, and (I'm convinced) no field testing. --
Example: [Bought two of these doormats got BOTH stolen] That is how good this mat it. It's SO popular.I bought it and placed it outside my house and BOOM! It got stolen.The second time, I CEMENTED GLUE my doormat and it was really stuck on the ground... and then BOOM! Someone decided to actually take the time to spatula my doormat and steal it AGAIN.That is how popular and awesome this doormat is... -_-
Example: [I am garbage] a horribly misguided attempt at satire. I'm honestly appalled that a publisher would even read this book, let alone pick it up for publication. SAVE YOUR MONEY.
Example: [new formula] I have been a loyal Cytomax user for 12 years now. Bring back the old formula. Stevia is just too bitter. I will not buy until it uses the old formula.
Example: [Choppahead] It is a little difficult to rate because I have not received it yet. There are many products I have not received but have paid for them as Choppertown dvd also. Please contact me because I have stopped to buy due to poor delivery. I think it is outrageous that Amazon.com can not deliver products!!!!! See for your selves; purchased Aug. 2006! It is not to believe. I have sent you e-mail about this before, still no answer???regards,Andre RifaatCell: +47 906 37 232
Example: [the clock sop] This story is about a girl named Christy and boy named Danny. They wanted to go to the field to go see the horses, so they asked their mom and she said, "No."They said, "Why can't we."She said, "Because you can't go by your self, you're not big enough." So ten minutes later they snuck out.I liked this Book because horses are really pretty. I think should read this book because it is good.
Example: [POS] This POS broke on first use after being hit by a snow ball....is'nt that supposed to be the idea????!?!?!?!?? Avoid Aviva products if this is a representation of their quality.
Example: [Disappointment with revised, shortened version] Having heard the original, much longer version, I purchased this CD expecting the same. I found the shorter version hard to keep replaying because the examples just became to repetitive. Would much rather have the four discs any day.
Example: [Far from scholarly work] I am in a quandry as to how this book could be rated as highly as it is here. Anyone reviewing this book with no agenda should beable to see this work for what it is, pap.Having read and thoroughly enjoyed "The Druids" by Jean Markale, an authority on pre-christian pagan religions in general and Celtic culture & oral traditions in specific, simply thumbing through "Diverse Druids" made me realize this was the work of an armchair amateur on the subject.Rife with the author's far fetched and unsupportable speculation, and reaking from redigested information that is basic knowledge to anyone with a cursory knowledge of the Druids, this is far from a scholarly work.
Example: [Guaranteed to soothe your baby!] I received this tape as a gift when my child was born in 1992. She loved it then and loves it now. The music is calming and sends her to dream land in minutes! A great baby gift!
Example: [Lotus Guide Magazine Review] Candida Albicans: Could Yeast Be Your Problem?By Leon Chaitow, D.O., N.D.Candida albicans is a yeast that exists in all of us. Normally it poses no problem, but with everyday stress, consumption of refined carbohydrates, and especially the widespread use of antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs, and birth-control pills, it can take over one's body and cause a whole variety of problems. This book eloquently explains how this pathogen gets out of control, causing fatigue, depression, chronic pain, digestive disturbances, skin problems, ear infections, and allergies, to name a few. What I appreciate most is the author's emphasis on non-drug therapies to support reclaiming a healthy internal environment. He uses the latest research and his own clinical experience to show how to detect whether yeast is the problem behind your ills.Susie Richardson, N.A.E.T. Practitioner (Lotus Guide Magazine), Chico
Example: [big shoes to fill] Though this movie is still worth a look, by being an unofficial companion to "paris is burning," there is a lot to live up to. That documentary has an almost effortless quality, getting to the reality and personalities of each of it's characters with an unparalleled ease. This successor at times seems forced, without a real logic behind why the subjects are special or why the ball scene still holds our attention. It's as if the director's vision was too broad. Maybe there was so much to tackle that a sole topic couldn't be picked. Still, its worth a look. You get to catch up with several familiar faces and see where these great underground artists have found themselves later.
Example: [Annoying - another movie without an ending - how French!] Here we go again! This begins as a paranoid thriller and ends up nothing but a tease. A man shaves off his moustache and no one notices. He can't convince them that he ever had one. Is is a plot by everyone in his life to drive him insane? We never find out. The movie ends very abruptly without ever explaining what is happening. A complete waste of two hours. The mystery is never solved. My guess is that the writer was too incompetent to come up with an ending. Don't waste your time!
Example: [Wears out quickly] I used to wear these shoes daily. Within 1 year, the stichting along the top of the toe came unraveled on one shoe such that I could see my sock while wearing the shoe. The soft leather at the back of the shoe along the achilles tendon became ripped up on both shoes with less than one year of wear. These are extremely comfortable shoes, but don't expect them to last. $150 is way too much money to spend on a shoe that falls apart in less than a year.
Example: [Very good!!!] Five go to smugglers top was da bomb! I liked it a lot, but I hated the part for Marybelle been so shy and quiet, but it was the best for Anne! I liked Sooty the most and his maid. that none forgiving Block was who I hated the most.If you feel like reading an adventure book get this one!I do wish Enid Blyton was alive and writing
Example: [LOVE] This is what you need for frosting cupcakes. You can't find these huge tips at a regular store. They are BIG. I can fit a finger through the larger ones. They are really well made, too. I love the cleaning brush and the storage container they come in although mine, unfortunately, arrived cracked, despite the adequate packaging.
Example: [Doesn't work as advertised] I followed the directions exactly, and it didn't work as advertised. The hair did not easily slip out, it came out the same as with normal tweezers. The hair also seemed to grow back as it normally would in the normal amount of time. The tweezers are also not very good quality. I prefer to use a pair I paid $0.99 for.This product is a total waste of money in my opinion.
Example: [Horrible - and downright dangerous] We bought this (twice, actually) for our baby's room. The first Vornado room heater we bought stopped working after less than a week. It would click on and off constantly, each day making more and more noise until it finally stopped giving off heat altogether. We thought it was just a defective unit and wanted to give it another try since we liked the idea of a non-kerosene heater. Within a few days of operating the second one, we again experienced the same jarring noises. One night I went into my daughter's room and almost passed out. Without adjusting the controls, suddenly the heating element went haywire and jacked up the temperature in her room to over 90 degrees. She had already been bundled up in fleece sleeper with a blanket over her. It's a miracle she didn't die of heatstroke. The unit went back the next day and we bought a kerosene heater that has been working well and consistently for almost 3 years now.
Example: [Down alternative comforter] I bought this last year and I have been very pleased with it. it is very soft and warm I use it as a top cover on a flannel top sheet in the winter.It is a nice size covers my queen bed..It is a good alternative to down if you are allergic to feathers like I am.The only bad thing about this comforter is it needs to be dry cleaned but then all comforters needs to be dry cleaned because they do not fit in an average size washer very well. I would recommend this highly
Example: [Reprint of the OR material] This book is a simple reproduction of most of the Official Records (OR's) material regarding Parson's.It is a good source for reference material, but does not contain much original material in assessing Parsons. It is unclear if the material is complete, or just a partial collection of the records pertaining to Parsons Command.
Example: [Collapsed and almost killed me] Bench collapsed and almost killed me after a month of use. A bracket bent like a tin can and snapped off a leg. I called the company and they said they would ship a replacement part. I waited a month for the part and never came. Finally called again today, back ordered for 4 months (probably because many are breaking). You should buy the Ironmaster bench. Best bench I have ever owned, invest now and it will save you dollars and maybe your life. Apex sucks ask my ribs.
Example: [Really terrible book] About half way through I almost put this book down. I slogged through almost to the end. But when two more innocent people were murdered, for no reason (it didn't advance the plot at all)I finally gave up. That was about 20 pages before the end of the book. I really wish I had stopped half way through. Actually, I wish I had never picked up the book in the first place.What didn't like about the book? 1) the heroine was not at all likable or someone you could relate to, 2) the hero was non-existent and 3) there were three murders of innocent people that were in no way necessary for the plot.Don't waste your money or time on this book.
Example: [Spruce up your kitchen!] I love these wall-mounted openers and have bought a few for friends. The quality is good and they make a nice addition to a kitchen cabinet or other location that would be handy for this sort of thing. Recommended!
Example: [Excellent book for teaching English writing ++] This book helps high school and college students improve their writing by providing clear, straightforward, and excellent examples of grammar, punctuation and sentence structures / usage. It has a short but very useful section on the process of writing / drafting an essay (it does not go into in-depth explanations on thesis paragraphs building etc. etc.)I love it and my students love it. I use it for ESL teaching as well as for native speakers developing their writing skills. The book is also well designed, with spacing that makes the text friendly and accessible rather than daunting. The photos are very good - normal people doing normal things, easy for readers to identify with and understand.
Example: [where are the extras] loved the show - sad it was canceled. would have given it 5 stars except there are no extras on the dvd - the websites had commentary and it would have been a excellent addtion for the shows fans.
Example: [BOOO!!!!] GREAT SERIES!!!! IF you can get past the annoying dubbed elevator music! OR the loser trying to mimic Joe Satriani on a guitar! I would have never asked for this series if I had known...Shame on me for not reading the reviews first!
Example: [Amanda Only] You gotta really love AB,Which I do... But even for me, It was hard to watch,Lousy story = lousy movie.Makes me want to watch "SHE'S THE MAN" for the 37th time.
Example: [Unrealistic] This movie claims to be based on a true story, but anyone with half a brain will quickly identify the unrealistic parts. Some in the scenery, some in the costumes, but most obviously in the overall portrayal of prostitution as being an envious way of life.
Example: [The holy grail...] For me, this book was the holy grail (and is)...this is the way of looking at the fretboard that I KNEW someone had to have the keys to. I felt it was out there, and knew it would help me if I could just put it all together...And here it is.Buy this book. No matter what your level. It will help you. There is no higher recommendation I can give than this : EVERY guitarist SERIOUSLY needs this book, especially if you're a "visual" thinker who needs to understand what you're doing, rather than just reproduce (sterile sounding?) rote memory...
Example: [This is a real disappointment] Angels could be a cool album, but it's just not. I was looking forward to hearing the old Amorphis singer again, in a new forum. He's still awesome, but the rest of the band is just bad. The riffs are unimaginative and the drumming is simple and entirely too bare bones. Really, what ruined this for me, I think, besides the fact that it's boring, is that I purchased and listened to Evoken's Quietus before this album. As far as I am concerned, Evoken are the reigning gods of funeral doom. In fact, they really need to come out with another darn album. Quietus is intense, atmospheric and amazingly complex doom metal. Go buy Evoken's album instead.
Example: [great tips] The book does offer some great tips. However, you don't have to follow the book exactly. Things could back fire. Do what works for your child and don't force anything. There are many suggestions that work such as being persistent and patient. It helped me tremendously with my daughter who has autism. This book was a great inspiration for me on how to help my child find ways to get past her food fears.Now she eats a pretty well balanced diet that includes fruits and veggies and less fried foods.Thanx Brenda!
Example: [Works perfectly. Easy setup.] Saw elsewhere in these reviews that this was not a genuine Microsoft product. That is not my experience. The item I received was a legit Microsoft product. Super easy installation with Windows 7 64-bit. Done in 5 minutes.It immediately synched with an Xbox controller I had already, and another 3 minutes later I was using the controller to play Skyrim... the auto-detected and everything. Super, super easy.
Example: [Uggghhhhh...] I can't quite comprehend how anyone, I mean ANYONE... Can actually enjoy this film. I mean gosh... the action wasn't just mediocre, it was HEINOUSLY horrible. Seriously... I have seen better action sequences from an old men swatting mosquitos. And the plot... It was like a bad mix of Pet Cemetery, Highlander, and splashes John Woo and Takeshi Mike elements. I mean come on... How can anyone in their right mind take this movie seriously? The script was litterally conjured up from a bowel movement. And even though I am an avid viewer of asian films and fluent in Mandarin, Cantonese, and Japanese, I couldn't allow myself to give this movie more than an one. Movies like this actually henders the Asian film industry from reaching the upper stratosphere of film making.
Example: [It's about as memorable as yesterdays dinner ....] OK so I bought into the hype about a hot hot novel with super corruption revalations about American big biz tobbacco industry and instead I got a rerun of the A Team 'in print' no less ....To say that our hero, Shane Scully, lacks depth of character would be an understatement and I can understand why he's ready for the rubber room. I can't realy say that I even like the villan, Jody, another cadiadte for the funny farm. When we get to the tobacco conspiracy issues we are in the middle of the book and the author gets really pretty fuzzy here....I mean where's the big secret, a few years ago Colombia had a member of government that was known as congressman Marlboro ...Sorry the only thing biting and gripping in this book has to be the price I paid for it .....
Example: [Contrived Christian Romance] I am shocked by the number of positive reviews on this site. This book was boring, slow, and depressing. Whenever the author was at a loss for what to do next, she simply killed off another character. The plot line was predictable and the Christian aspects were contrived. If you want to read good historical, Christian romance, look elsewhere. You will not find it here.
Example: [Not for Those Who Tend to Get Offended] OK, I'm hooked on "Dibley" and got this particular set because the no. 2 disc in my set of the first three Dibley's broke.I think it is a series worth watching if you are youngish-at-heart, and Christ-oriented or at least don't mind the somewhat-fantasied version of the church scene; otherwise, I'm not sure the acting is worth sitting through (the writing went a bit overboard with some of the characters to the immaturish, and the amateurish). Some of the story tangents are too rude for the conservative, but if you sit back and ignore these directing mistakes and enjoy the goodness in the stories and the characters, it makes a wonderful series to watch, over and over again.
Example: [Works well but...] This product seems to work well and I like that there are no harmful chemicals. However, it has a VERY strong smell that is not that pleasant.
Example: [Needs more power] We have this in the shop where I spend my evenings. It is hooked up to the jointer, and I can tell no difference when this vac is on or off.We have a 1 1/2 hp model with other tools and it keeps all chip outs and sawdust contained, even on the planer. But the single horse model can't handle the load and we end up with shavings from the jointer all over the shop.Pull the hose out of the dust port and try to vac with it and it does absolutely nothing.I suggest you spend the extra $100 and get the extra half horse, it is definitely worth it.
Example: [useful only as a prop] This cocktail shaker was badly made, was difficult to put together and pull apart. Fine if you don't mind spilling the 60oz cocktail all over yourself! Also there was oily sludge in the seams that was really hard to remove.
Example: [Wheel of Time?... Waste of Time!] Utterly, utterly auwful. Mr. Jordan, do yourself a favour and simply disown this book altogether. Just think, you could simply stand up and say 'no, I'm sorry, it was a terrible mistake' then write another book ten, which, hopefully, would be the last in this already hoplessly elongated series.The only reason you should buy this book is as fuel for the fire. And with the amount of drivel Joran puts out, it would probably give quite an appreciable burn-time.Yes, the great, seven-spoked wheel has finally ground to a halt - and to be frank I no longer care.
Example: [Maybe I'm in the minority...] ...but I found this game to be rather . . . boring.I bought it after reading amazing reviews from Playstation Magazine, IGN, and Game Informer.I just couldn't get into it.The moves seemed repetitive to me.The graphics, even for PS2, were lacking.The gameplay was very weak.I'll play this game for a few hours, put it back on the shelf, and not touch it for 8 months.I'll give it another try, and the same thing will happen.I won't touch it for 8 months.Maybe I'm in the minority on this one.I just regret buying this game.I really wanted to like it.I just didn't.
Example: [A fanstastic journey into the life of Lewis!] This book, along with Kilby's "C.S. Lewis: Images of His World" and Hooper's "Through joy and Beyond", is essential for those Lewis fans who like to see the actual photos of where is used ot lecture, walk, talk, etc, along with the other key places in his life. With high quality paper and binding, the text is made up in large part by interviews of those who knew Lewis. This is the best book on Lewis to come out in years. Well worth the purchase! Enjoy!
Example: [It Aint Easy] I have been looking for this music on CD for many years, I am extreemly happy and satisfied.
Example: [This story is the pits] When Romana installs a TARDIS component that the Doctor has been ignoring, a distress signal is picked up and the TARDIS materialises on the planet Chloris, a planet on which metal is in short supply. As they try to find the being who set up the distress signal, they fall foul of Chloris' ruler, the Lady Adrasta, who will do anything to retain her ruthless grip on the planet...Season seventeen of Doctor Who seems to be one in which the show lost its way. As a rule, the stories were less well thought out than they should have been, and contained somewhat ludicrous elements. 'The Creature from the Pit' is one of the worst offenders - science that it would be generous to describe as half-baked, unlikely cultures, and strange creatures all conspire to drown any good points which the story has.If you aren't a Doctor Who completist, look elsewhere.
Example: [Somehow it works] Finally, a hit for Salman!Well, this takes parts of every popular film in recent years (the part stolen from Sherlock Holmes made me felt shamed) but somehow all the parts come together.The film is never going to be receiving awards, and will not be taken seriously, but that is the point.Dabaang is good fun, and good throwaway entertainment.You suspect the film-makers know its limitations, but at least they admit it. I was bored rigid by Once upon a time in Mumbai, another film that blatantly steals from other movies, but is excruciating due to the fact that the makers think they have created a work of art.In short: if it is between this and OUATIM, then I would much rather sit through this again.
Example: [Lucky if they work for you ...] I bought these hoping to have a back-up for my current favorite headphones, which are so comfortable I didn't realize how spoiled I had been. I couldn't wear these, they were too stiff (I like the flexible plastic ones) so first off they hurt my ears = no good, second due to the bad fit, I couldn't hear anything. Now I rated this with two stars because my husband actually uses them. They seem to fit him. So I'm glad they are getting use, but I am still disappointed. I'd suggest looking at other, softer plastic headphones.
Example: [Downton Abbey Season 1 and Season 2] "Downton Abbey" is an excellent series. I have enjoyed every episode of both seasons and look forward to purchasing Season 3. Well worth the money. I will watch this series again and again. There is always more to learn of the history of the early 20th Century and the effects of World War I on families in England.
Example: [no music] You have a comment space for those that have listened to the music on this cd and there is no hypertext to allow one to listen to the cd. How can one evaluate the cd if you cannot listen to it?
Example: [Given wrong book] I was given the instructors edition not the student not what i paid for whats so ever so upset i just want my money back as this point
Example: [Great things in a small package!] I paired 2 of these 6751s with a 6750 polk audio package and an onkyo 605 receiver in a 16x16 theater room. I figured since we just finished the basement I would try to think to the future so I wired for 7.1 even though a lot of things still just play in 5.1. I'm not an audiophile but the sound is crisp and clear. I have an Xbox 360, xbox, and wii hooked up through the receiver to the 58" panasonic plasma. The surround sound is fantastic on games, movies, and tv! I definitely got my money's worth with these speakers! Amazon had great prices and delivery was quick.
Example: [Find it elsewhere !!] I ordered the item and I guess it was on back order, but no one let me know. So I waited and waited finally I sent them an email and was informed of the status. Took forever to receive the item I would never buy from them again !!
Example: [THE BEST CREEPY MOVIE!] ONE HOUR PHOTO IS OF THE MOST CREEPY FILMS I HAVE EVER SEEN ROBIN WILLIAMS DOES AN EXCELLENT JOB IN THIS FLICK, BUT THERE IS ONE THING I DON'T UNDERSTAND, I DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE ENDING ALL I SEE IS PICTURE OF SY PARRISH WITH THE YORKINS I SEE WILL YORKIN HUGGING SY, DO THEY RELEASE HIM OR WAS THAT PICTURE FAKE OR REAL OR JUST SOMETHING TO CONFUSE THE AUDIENCE?
Example: [Their must be a better book on the subject.] This is a poorly structured book. You will find on many occasions the explainations are not complete and what is written is unclear. Their are often refrences to subject matter that has not yet been introduced or explained. Leaving the reader lost. If you are willing to struggle a bit and supplement this book with other material you will find it has some value but for $59... I dont think so. I will be returning my copy shortly.
Example: [Bad size] Garmin GPS coverDon't make my error and assume this cover will fit the popular Nuvi series-there are none.
Example: [good toy,good price,] [...] It took about 10 days for me and my son to get attached to the toy.Now we love it.It moves forward and backward,honks,teaches a,b,c,1,2,3 and 3 shapes in english and spanish.The remote is a good size and shape for my 18 month old son to hold it.
Example: [Double the suggested retail price???] There must be some mistake here. This purports to be the car kit, but the car kit (KPA-H2C) has a suggested list price of $29.95 and sells for that at stores all over. At $59.95, this must be something else but since there is no real description, who knows what. Does this include an fm modulator? That would be a good deal.
Example: [Immensely Disappointing] I fail to understand the purpose of this book. My intent for this purchase was to get an introduction to Descarte's philosophy. To my utter disappointment, i found this book lacking any materials to this regards. The illustrations i found rather childish and annoying. There is no mention of Descarte's philosophy or any other subject that can add value or interest to a serious reader. I am extremely disappointed with this book, every page has an unnecessary illustration, these illustrations have no relevance to the subject. If the illustrations were removed the entire book can fit in 3 pages.
Example: [Very disappointed] Unfortunately we are very disappointed with this wagon. When we first received the box we suspected that this might have been returned by a previous owner by the looks of the packaging. The wagon was missing some parts, however Radio Flyer quickly sent them after a quick phone call. Now the canopy won't snap it securely to the wagon on two of the four sides. I can't put my one year old in one of the seats because he will pull the canopy out. I have to stop the wagon every few minutes and stick the sticks of the canopy back in the holes because they keep coming out. Overall, it just seems to be made very poorly and cheaply. Which is ashame, because my little boy loves it and it certainly wasn't the cheapest choice!
Example: [Eleven on Top] Just wonderful and with the saem characters: All fun to read with great big belly laughs! What a nice change from ordinary books.
Example: [A Must Have] If you are a true Vikki Carr fan your collection is not and will not be complete without adding this CD to your collection,some of Vikki's best songs are on this CD like Unforgetable, With Pen In Hand and of course It Must Be Him, I also especially like Baby Face and For All We Know this is just a small example of what is on the CD so order your copy NOW and enjoy.
Example: [Do not count on the software, 2nd unit stopped working too] After 30 days of use the software gives an error during uploading and never finishes. Seems a number of people have experienced this problem. No solution offered. I would get the cheaper model and NOT rely on the software. I mailed it back to the company to fix it, they just mailed me a new one. Product must be defective with software. The second one stopped working after 2 months.Do not count on the software, but the pedometer works as a pedometer.
Example: [fake rapper] I for one hate this cd. Mainly because He is a rapper from san Fransico who tries to be a hardcore Rapper and Challange people like Jay-z, and Snoop only that to get his (...)kicked in a rap contest by these guys. Dont by bother with this cd if you are a true fan of rap.
Example: [One Use Requires Two Sheets Minimum] The sheets are quite flimsy and thin, so I have found that I must overlay (2) sheets at a time when cleaning a pair of eyeglasses. I lay the doubled sheets flat and then spray them with cleaning solution. I found that spraying the lenses first caused the sheets to become oversaturated and to disintegrate on contact. Even with this approach, the sheets fall apart quickly. I will probably increase to (3) sheets at a time just to get rid of them more quickly. With careful use, they do leave lenses clean and scratch-free, but I will not be buying them again for cleaning eyeglasses.
Example: [Great size to take along] As with most Baby Einstein books, "Dogs" is a great little book. It is a convenient size to stick in your purse or diaper bag and perfect size for baby to hold. Small, but the pictures still bright enough to entertain a little one.
Example: [Disappointing] I am a power Yoga buff and do tapes of Rodney Yee (my favorite) and Brian Kest (if he could only talk less sometimes...).This tape as a number of flaws: the positions are too short, many power positions seem to me to be designed to inflict pain rather than to help the training and finally, the worst, there are some sort of ads during the relaxation phase, the most horrific experience I have ever had with a tape. I jumped up from my Shavasna in horror. I find the voice of the trainer slightly annoying, but that is likely to be a personal problem of mine.In short, I tried it a few times and then tossed it as useless.
Example: [I'm ADDICTED!] I am ADDICTED to ALIAS! This show is awsome. It keeps your intrest the whole epiosode! You need to own or watch all 5 seasons!
Example: [Pontoon post guide on] The installation was seamless and the kit contained all of the parts needed to complete. After installation the pontoon was guided on even in rough water. Much safer!
Example: [For Crafters only, no haberdashers need apply.] I bought this to replace waistband buttons for work pants but found that the fasteners will not hold very much pressure. I replaced buttons on two work pants and both popped back off the very first time I moved. I still use it in craft making as it will quickly attach a button on a decoration. When the connectors that come with the machine run out I will throw the unit in the trash. Oh, who am I kidding, I'll probably throw it in the trash now.
Example: [Misleading] I know, I know, I should have read the description better but hey, it says "Porter Cable 4210 12 Inch Dovetail Jig". Not "Porter Cable 4210 12 Inch half blind Dovetail jig". Anyone would assume you could do a full through Dove tail right? Ok probably not but just be aware of that fact.If you don't mind spending extra on full and mini full through dovetail jigs then the unit is well made.
Example: [Hoover 5507-900 Elite Rewind Upright] This vacuum could be a nice product. I will never know because the BELT buned out the first day.
Example: [In the Cut] This crap absolutely reeked! The story made no sense and Meg forgod's sake keep your clothes on, you are years past nude scenes.
Example: [say huh???] Just for starters, I am an avid MMW fan, and I need everyone thinking about getting an MMW album to think about this......DONT start with this one.....I have a real hard time understanding the other reviewers because to me, this is the least comprehensive album of their genius ever put out by them(I have every MMW release). Im not saying its bad, but if you want the best start with Uninvisible, Combustication, or End of the world party (if you dig grand piano, go with Tonic)....the other reviews are totally mad. Claiming that this is the most inspired and round about album they ever made is like saying the Beatles made better albums before Revolver.....take it from someone who has seen MMW five times in three years and skip this one for next to last (last being Shackman) However, I am not so corny to think Im always right, and in dealing with jazz albums, it is totally subjective as to what is the best....
Example: [Great frames for kids (and grown-ups, too!)] We have these frames in our home to display children's artwork. It's very empowering for the kids to be able to select their own "cover" art and gives them a great sense of pride. Lots of spinning & happy dances! These are much better quality than the knock-off brands. I have also used these frames to display full size magazines. Works great!
Example: [Amanda Caldwell-enrichment] Mr. Yochum's Senior English ClassI think that this movie version of Macbeth just did not live up to my expectations. I thought that Polanski's version was quite boring to say the least. Not that it depicted the play badly but the characters were poorly picked and didn't act very well. I did like the bloody fight scene between Macbeth and Macduff in the end. However, it sort of made me laugh more than anything. Although, the acting wasn't quite up to par, the motif of hands was still used just like in the play. I think Polanski followed Shakespeare's metaphorical use of hand imagery well here by showing the scene with Lady Macbeth sleep walking. Maybe I am to young to judge such a old classic but overall i thought it was pretty cheesy.
Example: [Hp Desk jet Ink cartridge] I bought a desk jet ink 3520 ink cartridge 27 black from E-z ink inc but it dose not work . when I received it and i tried to print out but it does not work at all.
Example: [great system] I got this game as a birthday present the pack had a lot. it came with a cloth,case,head phones,movie remote,demo disc,spider man 2 umd movie,and the charging set. the game played the movie great with subtitles,diffrent languge.and scene skip.later on i bought metal gear acid. it had great 3d grafics and sound. I also bought resident evil 2. it had traliers.subtitles. and looked just has good has it does on the movies.there is not many good games out now but starting september to december you will not be able to buy them all.a list would be metal gear acid,resident evil 2,reident evil,kill bill,kill bill 2,boogeyman,grand theft auto in 3d,midway arcade treasures with mortal kombat 1,2,and 3,mortal kombat deception with the full game arcade,puzzle,chess kombat with konquest mode,namco muesem,frogger. warnig case may scratch game screen.
Example: [Couldn't get it working] I spent about an hour experimenting with the enclosure, different computers and operating systems, various hard drives, etc. with no luck. The green light would come on, and occasionally the computer would recognize that a USB device was attached, but I would never get a drive letter.The documentation is mercifully short but unhelpful.
Example: [Awesome mouse] A great mouse, even for a Mac user. It doesn't support Bluetooth which is a con, but the mouse response seems to be better than any Bluetooth mouse I've used--perhaps RF is just better for desktop wireless mice.
Example: [THE GAME IS HARD BUT ITS FUN !!!!!!!!!] THE GAME IS IS NOT SO FUN IF YOU PLAY IT ALON BUT IF YOU PLAY IT WITH A FREND OR SOMOWN ELS YOU WILL HAVE A BLAST AND THE BEST THING IN HALO 2 IS MOLTI PLAYIR VS IN XBOX LIVE !!!
Example: [Large Speckled Window Perch] I recently adopted a kitten from Siamese Rescue. I was told beforehand that he had vision issues but loved his window seat at his foster's home. I chose this one because I wanted it heavy duty in case the other cat we have (who is the size of a water buffalo) wanted to sit there, too. I read the reviews that it was difficult to use with window sills that were angled, but bought it anyway.We took it out of the box, my husband said this will never work with our 60 year old sills. We put it on the window, and it fits great! No tweaking at all. It's very level, sturdy and does not wobble at all. Unfortunately, the kitten has more issues than we were told about, and is seems to be unable to learn how to jump from one chair to another, to the desk to the shelf. Once he sees Annie-the-water-buffalo jump up there, however, he'll figure it out!
Example: [This is the WORST!] I didn't believe that it could get any worse than "Bitter", then came this "Comfort Woman" thing. Where's the funk? Where's the fire? What happened to actual songcraft (somebody done got lazy on us)? This is music to watch paint dry by! I want my "Plantation Lullabies" and "Peace Beyond Passion" back, NOW!
Example: [Very Nice! Great Price!] It was a much nicer watch than I expected for the price. Service from the seller was exceptional. Everything went without a hitch.
Example: [solid, reserved, not balanced.] This album has some great tracks; Jealousy, Wonder, and my personal favorite, Where I Go, but lacks range. Merchant keeps a dark mood almost untouched throughout her treatments of these songs. The final track is perhaps the weakest, displaying little of her originality and lyricism. This album is well worth the money though, with quietly reinforcing percussion and good guitar work, but isn't a good sampling of her best work.
Example: [ATROCIOUS!!] Don't even THINK about wasting your money on this piece of crap! It will leave you with regret and broken ear drums. The songs on this album are laughable and cheesy, with horrendous vocals and a couple of butchered cover songs tacked on to the ridiculous re-release. Jessica is simply milking her last few minutes of fame and fooling innocent buyers in the process. Don't support this overexposed, overrated, talentless, greedy cash cow!!
Example: [Breaking the Power of Wall St] This traces the story of the development of the Global Financial Crisis. It finishes with a warning that the Obama legislation to prevent Wall St ever again bringing the world to the brink again, is in fact full of loopholes, mainly the fruit of wall street heavy campaigning and distributing largesse in W.ashington.Since this documentary, Obama has appointed quite tough police to enforce the legislation. Expect to see a lot of supplementary legislation to make the banks behave responsibly.
Example: [Much better the Bushnell brand] Much clearer than a Bushnell binocular that I bought and returned. I just wish it could be a little lighter.
Example: [Sad] This book is not only something you could just cry over, it has no happiness inside. I would recomened it to those people who would like to read more about the darker part of life.
Example: [THE ROSA PARKS STORY] This story is about a black women in the days of segrigashon who was sent to jell for not following the rules. It all started when rosa parks refused toget up for a white man and the polic decided to take this inisent lady away. But not any black person blame her for what she did but they did say it was her falt she was in jailin the first place. But you can't realy blame her she was tired of giving in to the whites because they were so cruel to blacks and she was not going to take it any more so she broke the unfear rules and she dicided to make her own. Later on rosa parks started a boycotand changed the lives of millions of black people and thats A great african americn moment.
Example: [Very disappointed :-(] Before I bought mine I read the reviews and reading the neg ones I thought to myself... They probably just didn't use it right... Well.... It really doesn't work, I didn't e even see any gunk in the cleanser and my black heads and white ones r still in my pores... Lucky it's not that expensive but still feel like wasted money
Example: ["The Office" gets endorphins going] My real offices-mates clued me in to this funny program. In fact, when I kept forgetting to tune in on the nights it aired, my boss finally insisted that I go home and watch it - that I would be "quizzed" the next day. It took a few shows to get to know the characters, and now I'm hooked. I have Seasons 1, 2, 3 and have had "Office marathons," watching successive episodes for several hours at a time.The funny thing is that at one time, I did work in an office which definitely qualified for zaniness of personnel. I went home each night, incredulous that work was ever accomplished. Watching the program is funny, sweet relief from real life, getting those endorphins going; and the DVDs are worth having, to view as the mood strikes. Highly recommend.
Example: [One of the worst racing games I have ever played] To sum it up in a word, this game .... The controls are poor, all the cars steer exactly the same, the characters are plain and unoriginal and the circuit champions always have some cheap trick up their sleeve by grabbing the SAME COLOR BLOCK EVERY TIME. The Build-A-Car mode is pitiful, because all the pieces are square allowing no aerodynamicness until you snag Captain Redbeard's set. And what do you get when you beat the game? Nothing. This game is horrible. Leave it to people who like throwing money away.
Example: [bad product] Received the product, but it was all broken when it arrived....the glue on the side didn't stick and the plastic/glass covering was broken...bad quality in production
Example: [One of my all time favorites] This is the kind of book that I want to buy 20 copies of and give to all my friends. Maybe some day I will. I read it over and over again. It's a great book. I love all of Sister's books.
Example: [Used Textbook] Was happily surprised to get this "used" book quickly and in perfect shape -- no bent pages, no writing, not even worn-looking.
Example: [Unusually light hearted and user friendly...] If comedy is, as they say, tragedy in long-shot, then Greg Watkins' take on Caveh Zahedi's semi-fictional love life is exemplary comedy indeed. The scenes with the adorable landlady from hell are worth the price alone. The DVD includes a not-bad commentary track by director and star and an amusing "Day in the Life" of Watkins by Zahedi.
Example: [Easy and fast waffle] It is easy to use, just pour in the waffle batter, about 5 min, you will have a nice hot waffle. The maker is non-stick, and easy to clean. Comes out perfect all the time.
Example: [Excellent water repellent] My daughter's waterproof coat had been laundered several times and was no longer waterproof. I bought Nikwax TX to treat her coat and renew its water-proof functionality. After her coat was treated she wore it on a trip to the mountains with friends to spend an afternoon sledding, throwing snowballs, and building a snowman. It worked great! She was recently caught in a rainstorm while riding her bike, and it kept her nice and dry on her 2-mile ride home. Highly recommend this product.
Example: [The title does not fit the book] I rate this book 1 star because its title "Programming Dynamic Character Animation" does not explain what the book is actually about. The book covers an engine that you could potentially write a character animation system on and static character animation(keyframes). There is no talk of even inverse kinematics. The only reason I could imagine why they would use a title like that is get novice programmers who are interested in dynamic character animation to buy it. I feel sorry for anyone who buys this book. It should be taken of the shelf as mis-information.
Example: [WON'T EVER SHIP!] This order has been the HUGEST pain in the ass. This product and it's inability to ship is uncharacteristic for AMAZON.I placed the order back in early July and I am still waiting for it. The pain in the ass part of it is that twice a week I get an email asking me if I still want it and to "approve" the delay.It is so annoying.I loved this movie. I loved the music and the story behind the music in a part of town I never knew growing up in Houston.I can't wait to hear the songs but I am about to give up.Order this if you have a Metric Crap Ton of patience and you are not in a hurry.
Example: [I gave this away] Not what I expected. I thought a square tree skirt would be different, it was. It has no ties in the back so it never stayed together. It was also the material of a throw blanket and it looked just like I cut up a blanket and put it around my tree. After a week of frustration I gave it away.
Example: [Highly recommended for neophyte UNIX programmers.] Steve Moritsugu and DTR Business Systems' Practical UNIX is recommended for UNIX programmers who seek a reference book of solutions for common UNIX problems. From modifying and compressing files to determining how to extract fields and using networking capabilities, this expands upon the UNIX platform of knowledge.
Example: [Farmall cub research] I bought this book because my late grandfather owned a farmall cub that has several implements, although it belongs to my uncle now I wanted to research it for its originality and the year it was made, a very informitive book.I found the book to be very accurate in where to find the information I needed on the tractor itself as well as learning about the other tractors Farmall made.
Example: [Only the best living poet.] Forget Seamus Heaney, forget Galway Kinnell. Paul Muldoon is the thing. This is an excellent collection of his work. Click around here, find and read a couple of his poems, and you'll know.
Example: [Nothing but trouble] I realize that not every printer will be as bad as mine, but I have had a plethora of problems. The on/off light burned out within 2 weeks. Practically every time I print something, I have to clean or realign the nozzles. For a while, the printer wouldn't work unless it was turned on before the computer. And if this is being miserly with ink, I'd hate to see what regular ink use is! You get what you pay for, I suppose.
Example: [Made me want to cry!] When I first read this book, it seemed interested because of the way the cover of the book is and how the words she said actually came to heart, at least, my heart because it made me think back how I grieved when my grandfather died in 1998. The book made me want to cry! But really, Maria Shriver is a good writer and I can't wait to get my hands on her next book!
Example: [Poorly manufactured and will stop working on you - I Promise.] Freeze ups in the middle of songs, constant resets with a paper clip, and finally the nasty "upgrader" message.. i.e means your up the creek without a paddle. Sending mine back for a replacement and hoping the problems are fixed.Not Happy.
Example: [Great book] This is a great book except I prefer the edition in the original language. The translations partly minimumize the puns.
Example: [Waste of money] For Christmas, I ordered 2 volleyball posters for my daughter. I was very unhappy with both posters. There was no mention in the description that they would arrive folded in quarters instead of rolled up. There were deep white creases across both posters due to being folded. This is extremely noticeable on the poster with the black background. The website also did not list dimensions-irregular size-17"x22"- will not fit regular size poster frames. These posters remind me of what used to come free inside a cheap kids magazine. Complete waste of money!
Example: [Defective Wranglers] The middle of the right front pocket was riveted to the right pant leg. The jeans were unwearable. These pants were definitely defective.
Example: [Not so great] When i received my video, i used it everyday for about 3 weeks, at the same time i went on a low fat diet as suggested and still the video did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. I think i could have done a better work out. I am a professional dancer and do not think that this video is effective. Next time, i'll stick to a personal trainer. If you buy this video, you are wasting your money!
Example: [Touching Account; No New Revelations] This touching account forces the reader to evaluate his own life in the light of the wisdom Morrie offered in his final days. But, I couldn't help but think throughout ... I've heard this before. An effective new channel for an old message about the truly important things in life.
Example: [The movies are much, much better] This book is the reason I've sworn off ever reading "classics" -- they're wordy and boring. This book feels like Carroll's attempt to "astonish" 19th-century adolescent girls. Wow! yet another impossible situation! Stick with Disney's & Depp's movie versions -- they're much more fleshed out.
Example: [110% satisfaction guaranteed] The movie itself is a perfect 100%. Good acting, good writing, good story. However, since I'm supposed to be reviewing the product, that is, the DVD and not just the movie, I think I'll give it a bonus 10% because it's got a lot a really neat DVD extras, like bloopers, deleted scenes, and behind the scenes production numbers.
Example: [Great toy] I bought this for my nephew. He loved it as soon as we pulled it out of the box. The only thing that would make this better would be to add a little more power to the drill. It wouldn't take the screws past about the halfway point. But it is still an awesome toy!
Example: [unsatisfying western romance] I've enjoyed a few of Ms. Joyce's novels, even the very un-PC "The Conqueror" but this one left me with a sour taste. With too much violence for a romance novel, at least for my tastes, and an unappealing heroine, by the novel's end I was left with a feeling of exhaustion rather than exhilaration.
Example: [A Multitude Of Mercies] This book is excellent. Anyone with schizophrenia in their family needs to read it. Written from the families viewpoint, makes it even more valuable. I highly recommend it.
Example: [superb] This is the greatest popular music album of the 20th century. Period. Apart from it, only Abbey Road, by The Beatles, shares the top position of creative innovation in the history of contemporary music.
Example: [Cool] It was cool. Same concept and stuff from the earlier Civilization games. Just looks a lot better. No problems here.
Example: [A Classic] HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES is a fantastic and classic horror film. The reason I saw this movie is because I enjoyed Rob Zombie's music {White Zombie and solo} and I thought it was cool that he was taking a intrest in love of horror films and he was actually going to make one and knowing from the music videos and cd's I knew it was going to be good and I was right. I'm a not fan of more recent horror movies {except for the remake of the "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and "Dawn Of The Dead"} cause I think the horror film genre has went down hill after the 80's. I really enjoyed this movie cause its like a classic horror movie and its set in a cool time peroid and its not one of those horror movies that make things so techinal. This is one of the most original horror movies that I have seen in a long time. I just hope the sequel is just as good.DVD: The DVD was alright but I would like to see the unrated version.
Example: [Excellent case for Pentax K200D] I bought this for a Pentax K200D and it fits quite well; there is a little extra space around the camera but not enough that the camera moves around inside. With the camera inside, the case balances well on the hard "cap". There is a velcro-secured pocket under the zipper lid, and a small zipper pocket on the outside front. Both are large enough for a filter or two, or memory cards and an extra battery.The included shoulder strap is of the el-cheapo variety, but functional nonetheless. The belt attachment is sewn-in and requires you to thread a belt through the case. I prefer the twin loop snap/velcro attachment of a similar LowePro case I saw in a local camera shop (which attached well to two rows of MOLLE webbing), but the LowePro seemed less sturdy and more expensive.
Example: [Coulda Been Great!] What could have been an exciting read is weighed down by superfluous description... after description... after description. I found myself wanting to edit the book - I couldn't focus on the storyline anyway! I'm glad I got this from the library and didn't waste money on it!
Example: [Incredible and emotional] I first saw Pavlo in a little restaurant in Birmingham Al. They were just passing through and stopped in to play. It was right after the release of His Fantasia cd. We were blown away. Since, I have introduced many people to them. I just got the Mediterranean Nights DVD. It is absolutely incredible. The talent, skill, and raw emotional. Unbelievable. It is truly a must see. Brian Richmond Virginia
Example: [Does its job] This water additive does it job of keeping dirt and hard water lime etc afloat in the water and making it easier to maintain the Venta humidifier/air washer. It was promptly delivered at a price lower than I can buy it locally.
Example: [Completely Unimpressive] I've never seen the show live or heard any other recordings so I can't say if it's Cabaret it'sself or just this movie that's bad. I found this film to be so boring and the music so annoying that I turned it off after 40 minutes. If you're a fan of Cabaret then you might like this (I really wouldn't know) but all in all this is a really tiresome film with only a few worthwhile moments
Example: [Excellent but the description is wrong] Okay I saw the movie just a few hours ago and none of what is described above is what I watched. Okay, yes a couple did clam to be forced to do acts infront of a camera but the rest of it is bogus, least the one I saw (it was a close to final film).Now to tell you a little about the movie, I'm not one for giving anything away so I'll leave it more as a "who done it" kind of movie.Silent Voyeur was leaps and bounds beyond what I expected from Georg Koszulinski. His first film Blood fo the Beast, was rough but anyone could see he had a story to tell and given the funds he could tell it, well Silent voyeur is it.The movie was at a perfect pace and always had you feeling wrapped up in the events. A great pychological thriller that should not be over looked.
Example: [Works but not touchable] It did work, but it made my hair feel disgusting. If you just need it to look fuller, but don't ever want to touch it, it's great. I think the TIGI little pump bottle (purple round dispenser) works even better, but still leaves a residue that makes my scalp feel like it is suffocating.
Example: [Generational touchstone] Okay, I'm 19 and most every other 19 y/o I know has seen this film, I mean it's like everyone around my age range has viewed this film and loved it. It's a great film and I just wish I was going on the adventure with them. I didn't want it to end. Hey Steven, do us a favor and put this on DVD! We need this! I've been watching this film on television for years and the nostalgia just kills me! I love it!
Example: [Alec Guinness is George Smiley] The movie, while good, does not do justice to the story. You need to see the Alec Guinness mini-series. I love Gary Oldman and he does a good job but the story is too neat, too easy, and worked too hard to fit into the 2 hour movie format. After watching the Gary Oldman version it just slapped me in the face how really good the diabolical chess match with Karla was in the Alec Guinness version, especially considering it was 1979 vintage. Even with that comparison there were still several very good scenes in the movie.
Example: [Large amount of space, but might not always work] This Gamecube Memory Card appears to have everything: Decent price, huge storage space, Nintendo branded. However, many people are having issues with the Nintendo Wii correctly reading it. That's not to say it doesn't work for everyone, I'm sure there are cases out there where it does. The internet seems filled with cases like mine, however. When you go to save a game on it, Gamecube games on the Wii do not recognize the card.
Example: [One word for this doll.......that is.....hmmm...] WOW!!!!!She is pure pretty....I love pinkhair..and her dress!!!So what if her legs are painted??It's cool!!Only barbies got the idea!!!Her hair is soooooo pretty!!!I reallllyyyyyyy like the curls!I wished I had hair like hers......ah well....I can dye my hair pink at least.....ok back to the doll....i was a little dissapointed how delicate the wings are....because after taking her out, Put her in the suit case and her wing bent....well I fixed it anyways.It's a good toy....really.Hope this Helps!!Barbie Fan
Example: [I love my best friend] a very heartfelt and warming movie. It shows that a dog is a man best friend that gives you that bond that you cannot live without. The characters are so great in the movie. I truly enjoyed this movie.
Example: [Hope all his future prdications never become true] Hope all of his predictions on our coming future never become true. May God Bless this World and its Living Beings.
Example: [Bitter taste] The seeds sprout well, it is true, but there is a bitter taste to this mixture. I use them on sandwiches and I thought there was something wrong with the non-fat mayo. Plain alfalfa sprouts taste much better.
Example: [Troy-Bilt Rear Tiller] The tiller works very well for a small to medium sized garden. It works vegetable refuse into the soil very well, finely tilling the soil. Make sure you fasten the clips on the tires securely or you will lose the clip and the tire will come off. Overall, very satisfied with the tiller.
Example: [Save your Time] It's a great book if you want to read about Mr. Greenberg's life. However, with respect to travel info it falls far from offering any useable advice.
Example: [it deservers no stars.] this the worst emo i have ever heard. The singer whines and writes the worst lyrics i have ever heard and the screamer is a little emo p*ssy. they play 2 power chords the whole song. if like this your a trendy rich brat. can't even belive victory records signed them for a good victory band listen to Martyr AD.
Example: [Bad Kindle Version] This Kindle version is bad. The words are blurry and difficult to read. Buy the more expensive version of this book.
Example: [you get what you pay for] I cheaped out and ordered this based on price. Good for general work and they are a bargin. I am saving up for a better set
Example: [Definately one of the best books I have ever read!] When I first picked up this book I thought, " well, this looks like a good historical fiction book." I was wrong. this book was not good....It was great! I actually read it in a day because it kept me on the edge of my seat. Other than keeping you tuned in, this book had a great moral to it, but I won't tell you because you need to read it yourself!
Example: [Not big enough] The Wii Pro Gamer's Case is a very good case. It does an excellent job of protecting your console. The drawback that I found is that it will only hold two of the remotes and numchucks. I need something that I can carry all four sets of my remotes and numchucks.
Example: [Much of his short fiction is disappointingly pedestrian.] There are some gems here, notably "Fondly Farenheit" and the previously unpublished "The Devil Without Glasses", but most of the short stories are decidedly second-rate. "Galatea Galante" is a clumsy Heinlein pastiche. "They Don't Make Life Like They Used To" is the sort of leaden "whimsy" which has plagued Fantasy & Science Fiction for the last half century. And several of the stories from the early 50's are thinly veiled diatribes against the paucity of original thought in "classic" science fiction. (Bester makes the wholly convincing argument that most of genre is little more than adolescent power fantasies, but fails to provide stories that provide a meaningful counterpoint.)Stick to the novels - THE STARS MY DESTINATION and THE DEMOLISHED MAN, Bester's best work.
Example: [Brantlinger Brings a different view] I really like the book. Her research is done with a select population of women, most of whom went to private schools as children. Thus there is an inherent bias but I think it brings a tangible light to the real divide that continues to grow between classes in America. This was a required reading for a Masters in Education class.
Example: [Boo!!!!!] Horrible Band!-Uncreative-3rd rate rock with mindless lyricsNo wonder their album is flopping on the charts and in sells...
Example: [Disappointing] Dead Tech -A Guide to the Archaeology of Tomorrow dates from 1981, with the English version in 1982 and a 2000 reprinting. Its coverage of dead factories, rail-yards, harbors, and aircraft boneyards is a disappointment. Manfred Hamm's inconsistent mixture of black & white and color photographs give the book a disjointed feeling. The quality of the photographs themselves is inconsistent. A few rise to the level art exhibited by Stanley Greenberg (Invisible New York) and Christopher Payne (New York's Forgotten Substations), while most are no better than I (a decidedly amateur photographer) might have done in a hurry with my trusty Pentax K1000 and a roll of T-Max 100 or Ektachrome 64. The accompanying text by Rolf Steinberg is noisome -- perhaps a victim of a less-than-artful translation into English. I haven't yet decided whether I will hold on to this book.
Example: [Great Book-Worst Seller] This book is great for the information, but I will never purchase from this seller again. Purchased on 4/17, email received shipped 4/18, received another email on 5/2 stating I would receive in a few days. By 5/8 still not received. I sent three different emails and could not get answers, when and where shipped from. I finally received the book 3 1/2 wks after purchase, and the book shipped from South Bend, IN to OK. It doesn't take 3 1/2 wks. even by pony express!
Example: [More than just a sci-fi flick] It would be misleading to say that the movie is just a brilliant sci-fi masterpiece. The essense of the Matrix is profoundly philosophical and spiritual. It actually makes you think about things that other movies try to make you forget about: the reality of this world and how you can personally change it.
Example: [A Cool and Excellent Book] Heidi is loveable, energetic, fun, thoughtful, and interesting. If you're into deep stories about a person's life, you should read this book. You should read it because you will probably find some things that you're dealing with right now too.
Example: [A perfect hit for kids] This movie, although a bit tough to understand for really little kids, remains firmly in my mind even though it has been about nine years since I have seen it. It teaches kids about the wrongs of slavery, and the idea that even a kid can make a difference. I can't begin to express my sorrow since they've discontinued it, I'm considering writing to the prouducer-type-people. Because if there's anything this movie has taught me, it's that no matter your age, you can still change things.
Example: [Barefoot Bride] i am enjoyed reading this book and will get more from joan johnson as the financies allow me to buy more
Example: [Awful] First off it is edited for G-rated material only - no nudity isshown - no swearing is heard everything is bleeped out and there arebig black bars covering anything exposed. So the title You never saw fits - you never see anything.
Example: [Looks great smells great!] I am a fan of turtles so i love this air freshener. It looks great in my green car. The women love it!
Example: [Easy, breezy, done.] Very satisfied with this product. Availability, price, and shipping were made very easy so I could get the item I wanted and have the perfect gift. Would definately recommend to friends and family.
Example: [black?] I bought this cd based on what I had heard in the previews on amazon, and I must say they are way too good for the album. Each song except for rust are hard to listen to for more than 30 seconds, because they are just power chords and screming, there is very little thought behind it, and it sounds like death metal, which was not what I was hoping for. Its not bad but for the black metal that we have heard from Darkthrone its a giant let down. Buy it only if u can listen to each song preview over and over again for 5+ minutes.
Example: [Closed Door] I did not see the value of this bland memoir. W.S. Merwin is a capable writer but the story he tells here will have little interest to any but close family friends and those particularily keen on this minor author's early career. "Without direction or prospect.." Words taken from the book that seem apt.(I do rank the book's jacket design by David Bullen as first rate.)
Example: [Rip-off!!!] Buying this cable is just like throwing money in the trash - cheap HDMI cables will do just as well as Monster. Monster needs to make products that actually have some justice to the price they charge. There is a small difference in analog cables and speaker wire performance, BUT THIS IS DIGITAL - THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE IN TRANSMISSION QUALITY with short distance connections! Cat 5 cabling with a HDMI plug at the end will do just as well!!! I have purchased Monster cables in the past, BUT NEVER AGAIN - this is treating consumers like they are complete idiots!!!
Example: [Kukuwa Dance Workout] I'm not exactly a beginner and the 30 minute segment got me sweating. It has fun combination of simple dance movements. For those who don't dance -me included- the steps are easy to learn after a few times. Remember this is not a dance video. It's a dance workout video. Kukuwa also is very energetic and her personality makes this an enjoyable workout.
Example: [Favorite soup bowl!] This soup is quite delicious. The broth is incredibly tasty and the fried tofu topping were really delicious and added nice texture. This is surprisingly filling given that the who bowl is well under 300 calories. I've tried most of Annie Chun's other soup and noodle bowls, and this is one of my favorite. Will definitely buy again!!
Example: [Excellent live album] The style of this live CD bears little resemblance to Fillmore East but it is nonetheless a very fine CD. Surprisingly, it also bears little resemblance to his then currect "Laid BacK" album either. This is Allman backed with a large ensemble doing a much more uptempo set and without much soloing. A number of the songs included here can only be found on this CD so it is a must for serious Gregg Allman fans.
Example: [Short-lived Relief] I had a flea infestation this year and thought I would try this fogger. I followed the instructions to the letter and even made sure I had more than enough foggers to cover the square footage in my townhouse. However, the results were less than satisfactory. Apparently, it killed the fleas but not the eggs. Within a week, I had more fleas (a lot more).Considering the amount of prep that needs to be done before fogging and the cleanup afterward, I have concluded that it isn't worth the effort.
Example: [love the Robb!] I love the characters the twists & turned all the cases take, the way Eve & Rourk love is so suited to each other. They work so well together. The other characters all have lives of their own but they are so much more when they are together. These books are aces in my book. Please keep them coming
Example: [If Only O.J. Wasn't in it] I love this movie. I remember laughing nearly till i choked all the way through it the first time that i saw it in the theater. I'd buy it right now if only O.J. wasn't in it. I just can't bare to watch the scenes with him in them, he has spoiled one of my favorite movies for me.
Example: [There are better cards on the market] These cards are alright, but the cards by White Rabbit Press are a true 5 star product. The Tuttle cards are small, thin, have only 4 kanji compounds, many of which are not commonly used. They have some typos, and the overall design is kind of ugly--the indentation is not consistent and the stroke order diagrams are handwritten! The White Rabbit Japanese Kanji Flashcards by comparison are beautifully designed poker-size cards with 6 compounds, look-alike characters and *imporant* hiragana and katakana (instead of romaji), and they come in a very nice box. It's hard to get the tuttle cards back into their box.
Example: [Excellently written--could not put down] I disagree with the reviewers who are rather harsh in their opinions about this novel. It has all of the key ingredients to make it an excellent example of the best of its genre. As usual, Cornwell's writing is superb--the suspense is gripping, the action flows throughout the book, her descriptions are vivid, and her characters are real and complex. Unlike some of the reviewers, I find her well-fleshed out characters to be one of the strongest aspects of her writing. I enjoy seeing the continuing story of Kay Scarpetta's world come to life, and I enjoy seeing her interact with the characters that we have come to know through Cornwell's previous Scarpetta novels. I say Bravo to Cornwell, and I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys an excellently-written murder/crime mystery!
Example: [Nat Geo 1152 Medium Camera Pouch] National Geographic products are made with the highest quality material. This is my 3rd bag or pouch & I'm already looking for another. Can't get enough. The pouch is perfect for a light trip to the Zoo or Park & you just need to pack a point and shoot small camera with a memory card and an extra battery. Adjustable over the head or shoulder. You can even tighten it around your waist and wear it on your hip. It has a front pocket for a wallet & velcro's closed. Well worth the money in my humble opinion. Very durable.
Example: [Works Great] This is A Great scale. It is heavy duty .Simply press one button and climb on.It is easy to see weight.The coiled cord allows you to set display at your prefered height.We are very happy with the 349.
Example: [Looks good, durable] Protects the iPod Shuffle, and more importantly, helps to distinguish which iPod belongs to which kid.
Example: [Diary of a Baby, Daniel Stern] It is a remarquable book und shows you an impressiv and new sight on the developement of the newborn child and the babies learning to use his senses during the first year of life.
Example: [twinings is better] Disappointed. Wanted to give it a try but flavor is not as good as Twinings. Costing the same as Twinings.
Example: [Redundance] I like the characters in Debbie's books but she is redundant in her descriptions of the characters very chapter or two.
Example: [unleashed] this album is wak! the whole bow wow concept in itself is lame this album has sunk to a new low even for him!dont waste your money on any one of bow wows albumbecause they all have one thing in common they allhave a corny sound to them!
Example: [Excellent Primer] I heard about this product several years ago and love it. Not sure if it helps with wrinkles but love it as a makeup primer. My face feels like velvet and keeps me feeling young all day. This is a must have for my daily makeup kit!
Example: [Wonderfully odd tales from the same city] The best way to read this book is to know nothing about it beforehand. Maupin has crafted a creepily odd and seductive psychological mystery that needs to tap into your sense of innocence and surprise; it is what you must bring to the read. At more than one point I was caught up with the "Wow!" of the plot. Maupin manages to mix the inventive and the autobiographical in a way that lends resonance to both elements, and if his emotional nakedness does not unsettle you, the strangeness of the story will pull you in.
Example: [I want more] These shoes are so comfortable, you'd think you're wearing nothing at all. Its also skid resistant which is a big plus! I'd tell everyone who asks me about it to go and buy it then again I also dont want everyone to have the same shoe design as me.I'd buy this shoe even at its original price!
Example: [Very Disappointing] I have not written a review before but this toy was so disappointing I had to save others from making the same mistake I did. Our Buckaroo will buck sometimes but it takes at least 10 tries to get his back feet down to play the game. It is something only an adult with just the right touch can do. Very frustrating for everyone. Please do not waste your money on this toy.
Example: [Best since "This Perfect World"] A great album. If there was an option for four-and-a-half stars I would have used it. Incredible songs as always, but what sets this one apart from the last couple is the diversity--akin to "Can You Fly" and "This Perfect World". For that reason, I can't imagine growing tired of it. And it's not just the varied instrument selection and production choices that make these songs so refreshing. The type of writing in the songs themselves varies from the specifically detailed stories--which he happens to be the modern master at--to the more ambiguous "Anyone", to the spare use of words in "Arriving On A Train" in which he lets the music tell the rest of the story. And the more unique strands of Freedy we get the better.
Example: [Chain saw chain] This chain was ordered for a Poulan electric chainsaw. It arrived promptly and in perfect condition. I am pleased with this product.
Example: [A wonderful remake of a wonderful show] One of the great things about this album is how the performances really capture the energy and wit behind Sondhiem's clever lyrics, and wonderful music.Each of the performers goes above and beyond that which they are called upon to do, and the singing becomes infectous. Nathan Lane is wonderful as the scheming Pseudoulus and each line is delivered with such a duality that it never becomes boring to listen to.This is the next best thing to actually seeing the show, and holds a place in my collection as one of my favorites. Wonderful.
Example: [In response to Ashton] Just because they play "math metal" like Tool does doesn't make them the master musicians that Tool is. Dream Theater also uses mathematical signature changes and I don't see any comparisons. I'll admit that the bass player is good, but as for the other musicians... well, they aren't the "best" as you claim. Check out Peter Lingrine (sp? sorry) and Mikael Akerfeld from Opeth for two amazing guitarists, and Slayers Kerry King for another amazing guitarist, Slayers Tom Araya for a better screamer, and Slayers Dave Lombardo for a better drumber.
Example: [Nice way to fill the hole] It's a nice way to fill the hole left by removing the factory stereo. Fits fine and gives you another place to store things.
Example: [Moved to tears every time I read it.] How beautiful! We all are imperfect, crippled in some way. Yet it is those imperfections that God uses best.This is not only a wonderful Christmas story to cherish, but a story to read to children, who are disappointed because they did not make the cut for a sports team, or who feel unpopular, or don't have the best grades even though they try hard. If you are a parent or grandparent, you should be reading this one with children in your lap and tissues nearby. This one is not just for children, it is a classic story for all ages!
Example: [terrible buy] I agree with the other reviewers - I was really disappointed. This too slim volume - especially for the price - is designed for a 5 year old - and a simple one at that. Not a good buy - WAY too little info and annoying hand drawn illustrations- all in all a terrible buy.
Example: [Lousy] This story couldn't keep me interested. The plot wasn't developed enough, the romance wasn't interesting. Skipped through most of the book, never found anything readable after reading the first 80 pages or so.
Example: [Cool Book!] I have owned this book before. It is very cool. I particularly like the Ninth Psalm of Yog-Sothoth and the Ritual of the Silver Key.
Example: [2-3 inches too small!] Others have said it well: but the box, find other liners. These are a couple of inches shorter than they need to be to extend over the lip enough to stay put. And, they're not particularly strong. My cat shreds them or pulls them down to cover her "deposit" ... the later leaves a fresh deposit on top of the liner. Clevercat can do better!
Example: [wwatch] good quality and value. Nice looking. Don't like the bi-lingual days of the week. Day and date are very hard to see
Example: ["This film has been modified from its original version ...] ... It has been formatted to fit this screen."That's the first thing you'll see when you start watching this DVD. The movie itself is pleasant enough, if somewhat derivative. The best thing about it is probably the cinematography of London and the English countryside, but you won't be seeing 30% of the picture in this cropped, full-screen, full-price DVD release. Disgraceful.For some reason, the very last scene in the movie is shown widescreen, so you'll get an idea what the DVD would have looked like if it had been released by a studio that cared about its creative artists or its customers. If only.
Example: [Get a different book] I had to use this book for a sophomore class in college and let me tell you, this is the worst book ever written. Every time I would read this book, I would immediately fall asleep within 10 minutes. Then, I would wake up and try to read some more and fall back asleep. This book threw my whole sleep schedule off and I'm not exaggerating. First, the book is hard to follow. Second, when the author tries to describe something or use an analogy, it makes no sense whatsoever. Some of the vocabulary exercises at the end of each chapter aren't even covered in the chapter. Luckily, I already knew 90% of the topics covered in this book and still got an "A" in the class, but I would suggest buying a different book unless this book is required in one of your college courses.
Example: [Great Concept, Horrible Finish] I read this book because the back cover copy was intriguing. The first half of the book was great, and peaked my interest...But its as if the author stepped aside and let a clueless idiot finish the book...The "Beast" rapes the girl then just walks away...and the girl is fine with it, and gives it up to her boyfriend immediately after? Was this some kind of comedic porno???If an unknown author submitted this garbage to a literary agent/publishing house it would be thrown in the garbage immediately.This book goes to show that well known authors can publish anything and people will buy it.Thank God it was short and I only wasted an hour and a half reading it
Example: [Who looks older: Hunt or Midler?] I agree with all the critical comments here: the plot is hackneyed and painfully predictable; Hunt keeps playing the same role over and over; Firth must've needed the money; Broderick is over the hill; I also agree with the positive reviews, in particular those who note that Bette was the one bright spot. I just couldn't make it to the end. All I could think about was how bad Hunt looked; is she anorexic?. Something seriously wrong here: Bette was born in 1945, Hunt in 1963! While I admire Hunt for her work offscreen getting the book made into a film, I'm afraid it wasn't worth the effort. I'm glad I got this through Amazon Prime. If I had paid for it, I would be annoyed more than I already am for wasting one hour on this film. Admittedly, this wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but it sure wasn't the best!
Example: [Stupid Book] I am shocked to read the other reviews. As another reviewer stated, there is only one word per page and they don't rhyme or even make sense. This book was a HUGE disappointment. I have literally hundreds of childrens books and this one is going to the Goodwill. The words are like, Ball... Oops. Why is the ball an oops? How did it go through the window? This book is just lacking in everything. Don't waste your money.
Example: [a hidden gem] Tried to find this book in a bookstore, and it appears to be self-published, but available online. I can find nothing about the author at all. No matter, this is without doubt the funniest and most unique book I've read in years. It's hard to pin down the story - it's more a free-flight fantasy into the minds of marginally functional people desperately clinging to their version of happiness, fighting the insanity of the `normal' people that surround them. If you ever wanted to laugh at the concept of `coping', this is the book for you. It's great to see a writer on the outermost fringe of publishing produce this sort of work.
Example: [Like it but......] My teenage son was bugging me to give him my Kindle 1 and was very thrilled when the Kindle 2 came out so I would buy it. I really like the Kindle 2, but for $359, why on earth does it not come with a cover? C'mon Amazon, this is a hefty investment in your product and you should have sent a cover with it. I am not impressed with the Amazon cover (which costs another $30) so plan to buy the M-Edge cover, which takes 2-3 weeks to ship. Now I am hesitant to take my new Kindle on vacation - I don't want to risk getting it damaged on the way.
Example: [im only giving it one star because you have to...] ok..to the "brilliant" people who made this...just like most of the MWC fans on here ive been waiting for a season set of MWC...i hear about this piece ...and i thought "hey! they finaly released MWC on DVD woooooo!!!!!"and come to find out..ITS ONLY 5 EPISODES!!! ON ONE DVD TO TOP IT!!!!!i have to agree..why is it that they can release shows like "buffy" and "freinds" but they cant release MWC!!it just proves that alot of these companys dont want to spend time on real classic tv shows..i mean sure theres seasons of the simpsons,M*A*S*H,hogans heros,etc..but theres more "modern" seasons then there are clasics..they wont even spend time on a wonder years dvd collection!but they will for "freinds"!so people...please save your money! hope that we will see a season of MWC on dvd..NOT 5 MEEZLY EPISODES!this is a piece of garbage..you (the fans) want a season...not this 5 episode piece of jargon!"lets rock!" al bundy
Example: [Attention getter] Just put it on a table and watch who picks it ups and starts reading. If you have a quirky sense of humor then this book is for you. Definitely not a page turner, more like, just open it up and enjoy! A friend gave it to me and I have enjoyed watching everyone from my mom to my nieces get a giggle out of any one of the pages. It is the definition of a coffee table book. Buy it and enjoy!
Example: [Clumps, but smells and tracks.] Clumps hard enough for scooping, but there is little to no odor coverage. My cat is long-haired and this stuff is ALWAYS caught in his fur and feet. I have to clean him and sweep the floors after every use-- it's very lightweight and flaky, I assume this is why it's always in his fur.
Example: [Fantastic album] This is a wonderful album. It's very mellow in that the songs are mostly ballads and mid-tempo. It's also a modern country album, but retains a little bit of traditional country. "Ashes By Now" and "Does My Ring Burn Your Finger" are traditional, but not too traditional for me to enjoy."Does My Ring Burn Your Finger" is the best song on the album and my favorite; the opening guitar work in the beginning is so magnificent that I keep putting that part on repeat, and her drawl expresses the attitude in the song. I love sassy attitude songs. :)The rest of the songs have enjoyable melodies except for "Lonely Too," which doesn't stand out. "The Healing Kind," "Why They Call It Falling," and "Stronger Than I Am" are especially touching ballads.This is a very smooth album and it keeps the mellow mood throughout, even on the faster tempo songs. It's a fantastic album.
Example: [Awesome with Ceton infinitv 4 , Drops it 20C] I got this because myCeton InfiniTV 4 Digital Cable Quad-tuner Cardwas getting hot , I put it Directly under it and my Temps went from around 65C to 42C at half Speed which is a huge drop in terms of PC component partsOne negative is at full speed (there is a slider for Speed control) it is really loud but at 1/2 speed where i run it is is not bad at all if not noticeableIt does glow blue which is cool i guess if you have a case that shows it but my case is closed so i don't notice it at all and that's better for me
Example: [Safe, comfortable, and easy to use] After contemplating convertible car seats for a few months while my daughter was still in her infant seat, I decided to order a Britax Marathon. I liked the fact that it would allow me to keep her rear-facing much longer than most seats (up to 33 lb.) and that it would allow me to keep her in a 5-point harness longer than most seats (up to 65 lb.).The built-in lockoffs have been handy when installing the seat in vehicles that would require a locking clip otherwise. The seat cover and comfort foam are very plush (we have the Houndstooth print seat cover) and comfortable. My daughter has always been very comfortable in her Marathon, even on longer trips.
Example: [Fun for a while...] My daughter has loved this soother for almost a year now, but we just discovered that it's been leaking. I thought that the water was evaporating, as the level was lower over the last month, but I discovered liquid dripping out last night. There are no breaks or cracks in the plastic; the liquid is coming from the seams. It doesn't smell like water (kind of plasticky), and, while I'd like to believe it's probably non-toxic, I'm still not going to leave the soother inside my daughter's crib.
Example: [Laughably dated] What everyone seems to miss in this tenditious tome is that it was based on Huey Long and was intended to derail his White House express. For a much superior roman a clef on the Kingfish, read Warren's ALL THE KING'S MEN -- even though it also is very loosely based on HPL's exploits.
Example: [It's better than most litter boxes....] But it's not "the" perfect litter box. Litter tends to leak out the sides when you roll it over. Sometimes, wet litter sticks to the bottom so you have to bang the bottom to get it to fall off. Next, if your cat's stool is a bit runny, and they don't bury it properly, it sticks to the sides and makes a big mess. It's difficult to scoop if you do find this situation before rolling because the entry hole is small. My larger cat tends to only step in half way so his stool is half on the floor.Although rolling most days is easier than scooping, it does go faster when you are in a hurry. If you have cats with perfect litter behavior and don't mind sweeping litter spillage, this may just be a good buy for you.
Example: [This book is sad and depressing.] I gave this book to my 9 year old daughter to read. She started it without me. She told me how sad and awful it was. I decided I should read it with her. She was right. As the story progressed, I was hopefull that the story line would become more positive and encouraging. That just didn't seem to happen. After reading a chapter, last night, I've decided to put the book down and not finish. It was extremely violent and upsetting to the point where I didn't want to even continue. This book is not for children, and not for me either.
Example: [Does the job] It does what it's meant to. Sometimes loses suction and falls off but not often enough to be a huge nuisance.
Example: [Star Trek Voyager] I have the full series on DVD, but since they are not HD they look good on my HD TV.I also have Netflix, again ok.On Amazon streaming there is an HD option, and the series looks great.
Example: [All Our Yesterdays] I bought this cd for one track really "Dancing In The City" and it hassome great other tracks, "Uptown Top Rankin" and "Motorbike Riding" are brilliant.
Example: [Love It] This is great music to fall asleep with if you like Bach or classical music. Very restful and soothing. I often have trouble sleeping, but this does the trick for me. The entire CD is over an hour long so you have ample time to wind down and drift off into to a peaceful sleep.
Example: [Soft, Squishy, gives you a good Grip] It's a little hard to put on, but once it's on you'll forget that it's there. I don't know how well it will handle being removed to change the batteries. Hopefully it will flex without ripping. Colors do improve the look.
Example: [Neck duster? Neck scratcher is more like it.] This brush has a skinny, skimpy tuft of very stiff boar hair whose ends are not trimmed to a uniform length. The sensation of having one's neck brushed with it is quite unpleasant. My memories of the barbershop of my youth is that the neck brush was a soft and soothing finish to my haircuts; this is the polar opposite. It's going back.
Example: [Some helpful suggestions but also some thoughts dated 50 years back...] I got the audio book and listened to it while driving to work. Although hearing some good points on unrealistic expectations I couln't believe my ears when I heard that "day care is the modern version of child abandonment" and that "feminists have messed up so many things"... The author seem to be suggesting to half of her radio audience to give up the double-income model and move to a little town in the middle of nowhere far away from all temptations... It makes me wonder what kind of relationship the author experienced with her own parents and I'm pretty sure I know what Freud would say about this... Overall quite disppointing.
Example: [Great Story. Loved the Symbolism.] I have been a Frank Peretti fan since I first read "This Present Darkness." "House" continues in the same vein with a horror story about the unseen spiritual world. Wars between angels and demons battling for the souls of men. As with most books-to-movies, the books was more detailed and better. The movie had to leave too many things out. But overall, it was a good movie.
Example: [Exciting time travel adventure.] This book is an exciting Sci-Fi adventure involving both time travel and the lore of Atlantis. After reading this book it is easy to see how the author can take sequels in many different directions. This author shows great imagination and the novel was flawlessly edited by an expert.
Example: [If you don't speak French look elsewhere] They never mention that it doesn't have English subtitles. If you don't speak French, pass this one by! It's probably a wonderful movie if you can understand what's going on.
Example: [I would bye the blue one] I got this lava lamp for my brother for fun "because it was so cheap" I recomand the blue because the bubbles are pretty much white and there easy to see. My brother is scared of the dark and keeps the light on 24/7, and the bulb is still fine. They have better but huge ones at "big lots" i don't know if they sell them anymore "anyway there 40 dollars there" I would bye one and give it a try you'll enjoy it, it isn't that big of a deal.
Example: [HORRID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!] I agree with all of the other reviewers in this category, The Ultimate Sin sucked!!! The production, music, lyrics, everything just was way below what Ozzy was capable of. However, at the time, this was a very popular album. Also, the tour was huge. This was Ozzy's glam moment. Gotta remember that this is the type of music folks wanted to hear at the time, including me (sad, I know).Unfortunately, with the exception of No More Tears, all of Ozzy's stuff since Bark at the Moon has sucked!!! Whats up with that? He is still good live, but the new material really lacks.
Example: [GREAT COFFEE BUT BREAKS] I agree with the rest of reviews, Brews great coffee, but likes to break after nine months to a year!!!!
Example: [Still Good] I picked up his first album Domestic Blues several years back after listening to in a record store. About wore it out, really enjoyed the acoustic guitar and mandolin sound mixing folk, country and blues.Had all but forgotten about Bap until I saw him open up for Mark Knopfler last week. They had his new disc for $15 bucks there and once again I'm wearing it out. Nicely produced mellow blend of original songs that I can't get out on m head. Now I'm gonna have to look for the ones I missed.Highly recomended!
Example: [My board couldn't live without it!] If you do your MXR homework, you will find that this pedal is the 'Best of Both Worlds.' With the 'script' button out you get the modern (block MXR logo) phasing. With the 'script' button in, you get the classic 'script MXR logo' sound. The 'block' sound is a more enhanced, full-range phase, while the 'script' sound is a more subtle phase.It's really like two phasers in one.I really only use this to play early VH, with the script button in and the knob between 9 and 10. It VERY accurately replicates that early VH sound. I also use it to play Paul Gilbert's 'Fuzz Universe' with the knob at about noon.I found it better to use this pre-amp vs. FX loop as the phasing was VERY IN YOUR FACE and enhanced in the loop. Placed preamp this gives you a nice subtle phase: You know it's on, but it's not overpowering.I've tried my fair share of phasers and this one really knocks out the competition. Great bang for your buck and a phenomenal sound.!
Example: [Not what I expected] I grew up in the 50's and used to sing along with a lot of records, so I know what the music sounded like. There are 20 songs on this CD, and only 7 of them are the original beautiful recordings. The other 13 songs are sung by someone else, and unrecognizable. Their music quality is very flat and tinny and goes in and out. And there were no samples to listen to. I returned this CD, and am trying to find a good one.Don't buy this CD. It is MORE than half bad!
Example: [College Cult Classic!] This Movie Is A Must See For Any College or University Student Who Is Majoring In Accounting, Finance, or Business. That being said, most of what goes on in this film, is basically an entertaining story line that has a little bit of drama and mystery. I love the Ben Affleck pep talk scenes. I love the "Recko" scene (classic comedy). I love the Wall Street scene. Maybe this film is what lead up to some of the anticipation for "Money Never Sleeps"...who knows? But Never The Less, Boiler Room is a classic in it's own right. And most of all, it's unforgettable. Nia Long is super sexy (not plain Jane). Her character gave the film a different layer substance which was very nice & fresh to see.
Example: [Bad Quality] It took longer to receive this item than it to fall apart. Mirror fell off as i was driving to work.
Example: [Awesome] Man o Man! You just have to hear this! It starts out saying, Today is Sunday and we've got the greatest Gospel Singer in the world! WOW is right! Then at the end when you hear the crowd cheering her on, it's so moving it'll make you cry.
Example: [very good gun] all i can say is very good gun my older brother gave it to me and it had been his for like five years already haven't had any problems dispite its long time of use
Example: [Too Difficult to Use] Yes, these are soft, but they're also not paper towels you can grab for a quick spill. You need TWO hands to get these off the roll. Its like static/velcro. I hate these, and bought the bulk pack, so I have a ton to still use. Give me the traditional, rougher easy to rip towels anyday. Would not buy again!
Example: [Diaper Cake] the product was not as pictured it was all apart in the boxthere was no bear or a stuffed animal they might have put the wru\ong order in the box but supposly the refunded my money I need to wait to see the bill
Example: [Precise and Concise] This is the most precise and concise macroeconomics textbook I have ever seen. I especially appreciate the abundance of colourful figures drawn, which makes it highly suitable for beginners of macroeconomics. For beginners, a good textbook should include the elements that are attractive to dummies. Unlike the other typical macroeconomics textbooks (which are wordy and lengthy), this book adopts the "to-the-point" appraoch which stimulates the readers' reading incentive. And you can finish the whole book in a very short time!Although it is intentionally for undergraduates, it is also suitable for anyone who have done the first course of microeconomics.LAW Ka Chung
Example: [OUT OF THIS WORLD...YOU GO GIRL] Loving all of Chante's music, she seems to write songs that touch moments in your life. We all know that there have been well written songs but the artist was not equally matched. Chante can sing anything and it will be beautiful. Enjoying this CD and waiting for the next.
Example: [Working for me!] I bought this book needing to get fit and loose some weight after nearly 3 months in bed with a back problem. I am now a little more than halfway through it and it is working well. Combined witha healthy diet I am losing weight. The exercise is also giving me more strength and stamina for my everyday life. I can now go out for a day with my husband without having to call a half after a couple of hours and be taken home.Worth twice the price!
Example: [I hate the clips] My rollers are constantly popping out of the clip holders from this set, regardless of me using more or less hair. Maybe there is a magical perfect portion of hair to roller ratio. If so it is impossible to find. I dunno, but I do know I would NOT recommend these. Also even when I get these to stay in my hair, my hair doesn't curl nearly as much as it usually does in hot rollers. Overall buy something else.
Example: [Worse Than Legend!] I should know better by now than to trust a Mark Dacascos movie. This film is an insult to Matheson's orginal story. Dacascos' acting hasn't improved a bit. Even his kung-fu skills seem to be fading away.I'm so tired I don't even want to finish this review, so I'm not . . .
Example: [Dreadful] This movie is absolutely terrible. Do not waist two hours of your life watching this film. Poor sub-titles, no action, and a little perverted, too. I'd rather sit in a doctor's waiting room than to have watched this movie.
Example: [Broken] This humidor was a gift for my Brother-In-Law, and arrived with the glass shattered. I was very disappointed, and will not order from this company again.
Example: [Excellent specific and general ideas] He is always good....great reminders and specific information as well as general affirmative statements..have not finished it yet
Example: [Standard Kundera: brilliant] The great thing about Kundera novels is that they say things. This is a big problem with a lot of novelists writing today--they aren't saying anything. Plot takes a backseat to what Kudera is saying, though the plot isn't bad. It is difficult to peel back the layers of Kundera's point, but--as the title shows--he's commenting on identity: the identity we create for ourselves and the identity we create for others in our own mind. The novel raises more questions than it answers, but that's the sign of a great novel. Isn't it?
Example: [A TOTAL WASTE......] This product does not stand up against trying to cut grass, let alone any kind of weed!! Don't waste your time or money on these or the seller who would not make themselves available for any inquiry.
Example: [Bad Player & Bad Service] Out of the box the Rio 800 was a lemon. It crashed on half the songs I loaded, the battery showed full when it was almost empty and, best of all, the people at Rio don't exactly respond quickly to requests for repair or exchange. The unit is sitting in a drawer while I wait for their Customer diService department to get back to me. Maybe I'm too impatient, after all, I emailed them barely a month ago.
Example: [it works!] We bought this product six years ago.............the Mazda MX5 vinyl top still looks new, and has kept its flexibility........yes, we garage it, and treat it like the classic it is.......recently renewed our supply thru Amazon.............same product, same ease of application. I love it when products do exactly as advertised!
Example: [Waste of time] I agree with all the negative things other reviewers have said about this book...interesting premise not executed well. A bunch of women who have nothing better to do but hang out in a knitting shop all day? Please. A white man who discovers that his grandfather was black and now must deal with the fact that he is an "African American"? Again, please. And the baby in question, of course, is fantastically beautiful with "golden" eyelids, etc. The people are one-dimensional and there are too many plot lines that are left hanging at the end. A really good novel about this topic would have been a treat. This is a throwaway beach read at best.
Example: [Let's Be Honest] This book has a religious orientation that is not revealed until you open it and start reading. I have no objections to religion for those who choose it, however, I resent the "hidden agenda" aspect of this book. If I had known in advance this was a religion-based book, I would not have bought it. I think that's the idea behind their keeping quiet about it.
Example: [There should be a "0 star" rating...] Regardless of your political views, this is a poorly thought out excuse for a film. Anyone with more than a room temperature IQ will quickly be disgusted by the filmmaker's pandering and patronizing.
Example: [NOT SO GREAT] This game is very difficult to play . has alot of gliches, you have to keep buying food and water to feed your dog, well before you know it its all gone and you have to go to the pet store again, I tried to help my granddaughter get the dog to do tricks and its literally impossible, all it will do is sit. I can not make it do anything else I have tried everything and I am 49 years old, so how can a child be expected to learn the dog tricks. I still can't figure out how it is suppose to get sleep zzzz, or get him to go in the dog house. The game is frustrating for any child.
Example: [Worse harlequin I've ever read] I really don't understand the 5 star reviews. Normally, I try to keep an open mind to others' likes/dislikes, but this is one case where I am completely baffled that anyone would like this.There is NO chemistry at all between any of the characters. He threatens her no less than 4 times by saying either "if you were a man, I'd hit you" or "I'll kill you". Normally when the H/H get 'busy' any semi-reluctance has long since been banished, it almost feels like he assaults her in this story.I just can't stress how horrible this book is.
Example: [Good for only a year give or take...] Well I loved this Fm radio adaptor for my nano but it's been almost a year and it started acting a bit funky till the next day it just stopped working completely. So if I were you, do not waste 45-50 dollars on this merchandise if it's not going to last. I love apple but the fact that they didn't want to give me another one makes me not want to buy there product. The reason they ask for more money for a 2 year guarantee is because their products will eventually stop working. THIS IS JUST A WARNING:)
Example: [It kind of sucks!!!] I see my first review wasn't posted, maybe I was too mean. So I'll just say for a British House music lover, this CD & the import is a let down. But check out the remixes that are out there......
Example: [Pretty Cool!] It's amazing that there are so many private stuff in this books. I think children should know about sex at a young age because it will happen to them when they get older, like age 8. Go books!
Example: [love these!] These sort of hurt a first but after a few wears they are easy to use. I wear them to sleep sometimes. I think they have helped to mitigate bunion formation in my right great toe. I also use them when I do my own pedicures. I'm glad I bought these as they are durable and effective and non invasive.
Example: [clearjel starch] this starch is easy to use and the batches of canned peach pie filling were beautiful. will get more next year.
Example: [Tired] Having lost faith and taken a skeptical approach to religion I was hopeful that this book would lead me into rethink.No way! Tired and inaccurate, not a waste of time though as I found myself constanly jumping up with "That's not true." "What a jump!" and that's a downright fabrication!"
Example: [Powell rocks..] I think Palmer was still drumming with Asia when they made this one, which explains the different drummer. Everything else you might expect is as close to pure ELP as you can get. "The Score" has Emerson's grand, energy-packed keyboard playing a la "Brain Salad Surgery." "Touch and Go" leans toward the tone of "Black Moon." This whole album is not quite their '70s sound or their '90s sound, but somewhere in between. Some songs capture the best of both, such as "Learning to Fly." If ELP hadn't broken up in 1979, this is what some of their 80s stuff might have sounded like.
Example: [Christmas present] Bought this for my son who just purchased a mandolin. Had to let him open it early to use for some special music at church. He said it made it so much easier to play. Looks nice too.
Example: [Oy! Not What I expected] What can I say....I love Kodo. But this was not Kodo. While I'm sure the remixer's, DJ's, Et`al, might have meant well...What they did to this album is a grave injustice to Kodo. The tracks were so remixed, distorted, folded, bent, stapled, and mutilated. That I thought the Postal Service had gone into the Music Recording Industry to supplement their profits... I couldn't tell if most of the tracks were based on Kodo's works or not for the most part... Next time Kodo allows remixers to use their works. They should definitely put it in the contract someplace. That the tracks should at least resemble their original compositions in a more identifiable fashion. I love techno as much as the next person, but this was even beyond my tolerance...Guess I'm just a purest at heart, when it comes to Kodo and their style of Tiako.
Example: ["after fight club, the volume gets tuned down(...)"] ...Well, the same could be said of Mr Palahniuk's inspiration lately.Here is a compilation of his writing which reads more like articles than essays : demolition, castles, marilyn manson, hollywood, ghosts, etc... it's more of a bazaar. Gonzo journalism somehow...I skipped a lot of chapters just like i pick the juicy parts in my newspaper.I enjoy very much Mr Palahniuk novels, but it's not because you have talent and you sell, that you must publish everything you write.If you're a fan, you'll buy it anyway.Otherwise, wait until it's in paperback or get it at your local library. The price is defenitly not worth it. His Portland, Oregon guide is at least much more fun to read.
Example: [Whatever!!!!] The contents of this book are extremely offensive. I'm a muslim and from my point of view this book is biased. Lewis generalizes way too much. Sure there are some muslim extremist but what religion doesn't come with it's share of bad apples? If Islam is so "evil" and whatnot then how come even today you find old churches from way back in muslim countries yet in christian or jewish countries you only find ruins of what was once mosques? It's because Islam is a tolerant religion, and always has been, that's why. Again, what religion doesn't come with it's share of fanatics?
Example: [Pretty good, but needs attention] The actual function w as great, I was putting together an amplifier, but the only problem I had was that the pins came out after a little tug. This tug wasn't that bad either, I had soldered wires to pins 1-6 and I pulled on pin 3 not vary hard(maybe at 5 lbs of force) and it just slipped right out. Not the best thing after some extensive solder work but good thing I got more than one. Good price and functionality is superb.
Example: [One of the Best Books of all Time] This book is a masterpiece of Truth and Light. You cannot put a price on it! God bless you M. for so faithfully capturing the words of a Master. I only have to read a few pages and I find myself so uplifted and blown away by the simplicity and depth with which eternal truths are captured. An essential book for those who are on the Path.
Example: [Weak in comparison...] The only valuable part of this book was the list of Japanese terminology in traditional Ju Jitsu, plus a decent history section. Overall, though, the number of moves they offer is miniscule compared to other books on the market, and the pictures are so infrequent that, in a photo sequence, I often had no idea how the person got from their position in Photo 1 to their position in Photo 2. It's actually pretty funny. You'll have some guy doing something -- and, next picture, they're in an entirely different position. With the recent spate of Ju Jitsu and BJJ books, this is very outdated and I think would serve only as a broad introduction (like an extended Encyclopedia article).
Example: [Just a fun movie] Sit back and enjoy this version of Holmes. They could be a little more clever and a little less high tech but the acting is first rate and maybe they can evolve into the head game masters that Holmes and Watson are in other iterations.
Example: [King of Hearts DVD] Movie itself is great. It was sent as a gift to friend in London who couldn't view it. Did I miss the zone information? and it came with no cover, only a sleeve. all in all the first unsuccessful purchase. alas
Example: [The deodorant had a nice scent and worked ...] The deodorant had a nice scent and worked well in keeping me dry. Even after a day, I could feel that it was still on me. I would recommend it to someone because it's a good product.
Example: [these guys are horrible and pretentious] I work for a radio station. These guys were all the rage a few years ago, so I was sent out to a concert to get the inside scoop. I hated the show. The guy is talentless: he can neither sing nor play the guitar. The lyrics are strained and mock-absurdist. The guy is visibly aching for attention--"Don't you people think I'm weird?" When I interviewed them after the show I felt like pissing the whole time so I was extra-irritated by things I would normally overlook--i.e., the guy kept scratching his hair like some eccentric and I was on the verge of spitting in his face. So, lucky me: I was asked to review this album by the station. . . you can imagine the long harangue I launched against this godawful band. But nobody seems to mind me.
Example: [sucked, actually] a bitter disappointment. like getting coal for christmas. the plot was flatter than the DVD itself, and the characters were cliches with british accents.
Example: [Far too big...] I ordered these hoping that I'd have some great new silk pajamas to replace mine that had worn out. Let me tell you, if you're a small person like I am these are not at all for you. You will be completely drowning in them. I looked like I was 5 years old and playing dress up in my mother's clothing; the small is not at all small... I was highly disappointed.
Example: [Perfect! Get ready for your Fantasy to unfold] I'm Britney's #1 fan, a guy, and not gay. But I still bought Fantasy and Curious because I get everything she puts out. This really is VERY sexy smelling and I plan on buying it for my girlfriend someday. It smells like a forest, then cupcakes, musk, and is extremely sexy. Girls: buy this and your boyfriends will love you. I was in a lunch line and I smelled the girl next to me wearing it's distinct scent. I was drawn to her. Get my drift? It works! Buy it!
Example: [Familiar format for seniors] I purchased this book for my senior parents who have in the past year bought not one, but two new computers. Brave as they are, computer jargon is new to them, and sometimes I am hard pressed to help them out long distance. It was great to find this book that looks SO MUCH like the red Reader's Digest Do-It-Yourself book that has occupied my father's bookshelves for as long as I can remember. That familiarity is bound to feel something like climbing a new mountain in a pair of comfortable old jeans.
Example: [Great product] This is a fantastic tool. Easy to use, and does cut down on shedding. A little pricey, but I believe it's worth it.
Example: [Gm blower motor] Hey this was a good buy! It was cheaper than auto zone, shipped free, was simple to install! Best part is that it works perfect!!!!!
Example: [The Codpiece of Doom] The blu-ray is kind of unnecessary, as the film stock used to shoot the movie is not digital film, but the features were fun, the movie is a classic... and it's cheaper on blu-ray than on DVD... so what are you waiting for? BUY THE MOVIE! :)
Example: [Upstate New Yorker] All her books are great reading!This one is really good!Would buy againWill definitely buy more!
Example: [Poor and disapointing] Typically for the British:1. Lack of objectivity2. Lack of humility3. Eagerness to blame the foreigners4. The nationalistic bias5. FEEL-GOOD atmosphere
Example: [A fair book] +AH4-This book is unusual. It's very boring at some parts (I fell asleep reading this book). There's only a few exciting parts but they wear off fast. You should try reading his better books first.+AH4-
Example: [Hobb is Burnt Out] After reading the 1st two books in Robin Hobb's Farseer Trilogy and enjoying them immensely, I was more than just a little disappointed in the 3rd volume. Hobb appears to have burnt out. He devotes pages and pages to boring pointless journeys, opens a promising theme - Old Blood - and never develops it and his evil king character develops a split personality, alternatly swinging from evil genius to drug addeled dilettante. I finished the book but it was so poorly done I had a real hard time not just chucking it part way thru.
Example: [Terrible PRODUCT-Whats going on with SONY DVD players] ALL current HDMI Upscale DVD players on the market are FIRST generation products and are all in need of work. However I cannot afford to waste money or time until they get it right. The HDMI connects looked great...it stopped working within 48 hours. So then I was left with only the progressive outlets working till I worked on returning this item. Then I noticed that the progressive connects (yeah they worked) but looked HORRIBLE. So I went back to my old sony 425P. I love this player and in my opinion is one of the GREAT dvd players sony has made 2+yrs and running strong.So please avoid this player read the rest of the reviews and wait for awhile till they submit a new model with HDMI connects
Example: [Good Ideas, Bad Writing] Reading through the table of contents shows a wide variety of prayers on topics from Prayer to the Dawn to Prayer to Save the Rain Forests. Unfortunately, the prayers themselves are dry and contrite. They state the spirtual need in a matter of fact, textbook way. No sense of artistic flow. For the Star Trek fans out there a good example of a poem Data might write.
Example: [Not the same as Ghiradelli] They are now made by a different company, TJerrild, located in Fresno, CA. They definitely do not taste the same as Ghiradelli. Supposedly they are made with the same ingredients, but I would say not the same recipe. A huge difference in taste form when I was a kid. Thanks for the memories Ghiradelli....
Example: [Important stuff but hard slogging] This is an encyclopedia, and reading such things is not what most people, even when deeply interested in the subject are likely to do. It does provide a fair reference for specific topics, but this is not a subject one can really pick and choose.VAR is the ususal starting point, and its famous authors (one of whom I hired for his skill in these matters) cover most of the bases in an interesting way.
Example: [Unless you love Zeppelin, there may be a better album foryou] I love this album.However, if you're looking for 'The Best of Zeppelin', look at 2, 3, 4/Runes, or Houses of the Holy. In fact, buy those first, this next, then Presence. The main attraction of this album for me is the song Kashmir, which made the purchase more than worth it.
Example: [A real letdown] I have all the Zen Garden recordings and this one is a total letdown. Do not buy this CD because it does not live up to the standards of previous Zen Garden albums. I use this music to help me sleep (due to chronic insomnia) so I am not asking for more than capably produced, relaxing sounds. This CD is just awful. Get Restful Earth instead, it is a much better disc.
Example: [If you want to be a better friend, read this book!] If you are looking to be a better friend to your closest friends, I highly recommend this book!
Example: [Useful at first, but not for long] We bought these books to teach us come finer aspects of Visual Test, and they do just that -- to an extent. Unfortunately, after the first several chapters, it quickly becomes useless, barely covering some very important aspects of the product (file I/O, pointers), and spending entirely too much time explaining how to test Wordpad. I would rather have a good reference for this product than this.It seemed a little half-baked. It was good in some areas, but for the most part lost usefulness quickly. I can't in good conscience give this any more than a mediocre review.
Example: [rainbow popsicles and diamond-paved streets] Music to go on a picnic to, or drive around to on a sunny day with someone you like a lot. Cub makes me feel cheery. . and wistfull. It's kind of like eating really good candy.
Example: [How do you get it to work?] I was really looking forward to seeing the art but I put the CD's in and nothing happened. At all! I knew it wasn't my computer and tried all of the CDs. What a disappointment. I returned it and hope to find something similar that works! Maybe I just got a bad set.
Example: [Flimsy Construction] The cylindrical housing around the lens is attached to the body in a very flimsy manner and comes out easily
Example: [Fifteen shades of manic fun!] I'll keep this short and sweet: I haven't had this much fun with a record in a VERY long time. I don't think they could've crammed any more influences into their sound if they wanted to. This CD is just sheer, unadulterated party music... "Kountry Genlteman" and "Luv Addict" are standouts, but there's not a yawner here! Put this in rotation at your next party and kick the good time up about two and a half notches!
Example: [Not worth it] Very disappointed with this pair of Apple Bottoms! I have several pairs and this one is not worth it. Neither the product description nor the pictures on the website give you a very close look at the jeans. Some of the "special details" make it seem as if the item were damaged. It doesn't look cool!
Example: [Bears in the Barn] I ordered this book for my granddaughter for christmas on Dec 3th and recieved it when I was informed of the shipping date. My granddaughter enjoyed this book very much. I had a very good experience with this company and would order again from Internationalbooks. Keep up the good service.
Example: [Ugh; not mysterious, thrilling, romantic or humurous--annoying and boring read] Ugh. This was the worst in the series by far; it was literally a chore to drag myself through the end. All the stuff about Eddie Kroll is just completely irrelevant and stupid and detracts from what's supposed to be the main story. Nina was also incredibly stupid and annoying, and as other reviewers have mentioned the killer was quite obvious and the resolution a mess. By the time I got to the end I was just finishing it to finish it and was completely unconcerned and uninvolved in what was happening. A terrible read; the first two (Cold Truth: A NovelandHard Truth: A Novel) are worth borrowing, but this one isn't even worth that. Lacks suspense, romance, mystery, humor--it doesn't have a single redeeming quality. Borrow the first two in the series, but this one isn't even worth that.
Example: [disappointing sound volume] I was surprised with the low volume level, especially after reading the reviews here. With the volume on my cell turned all the way up, the earpiece is still pretty quiet, and I even have trouble hearing some people at all. However, I am using the headset with an LG VX3300, which I suspect has a low powered external jack. But, even with a $10 inline Sony earpiece (with a regular earbud that doesn't go into the ear canal), the volume is higher. Also, people on the other end of the line hear me more clearly when I'm not using the headset.
Example: [Just Great!!!!!] I had been worked with VB a little before, then I got this book and it's....WOOOOAOAOAOAAAH! It gives a great base to the language, and something on its subset (VBScript/VBA/ASP).The book does get through a lot of things linked to the language, its components and things like that. However if someone wants to get 'professional' about a detail (eg: WinSock), one has to look elsewhere. This said, the background provided by this book makes understanding these 'extras' an easy thing.Having access to M$'s MSDN is an extra help (in this, and any M$ language/sytem), for refering to API's and 'hidden' details.
Example: [Non intuitive and full of bugs] After 3 days of intensive learning I still can't do some very basic things, it takes me sometimes hours of research to do the most simple things ... like gradient painting a circle object while it takes one intuitive action with my previous software to do that. I find Photoshop CS2 is too complexe in its structure, vocabulary and workflow philosophy for the occasional user. I reckon it takes at least 2 full weeks of training to manage this software, far too much in my opinion, I mean we're talking of image processing ... in comparaison it took me 1 week to manage Autocad and about 2 weeks for a FEA pro softaware.
Example: [WARNING TO PARENTS!!!] This series is intended for Ages 8 to 12 and this Book Two is TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE for this age group. There is graphic cruelty to animals which is even depicted in an illustration!!! The bad fairies catch a domestic cat and roast it on a spit! Children will either be traumatized or intrigued by it - both very BAD! There are too many good alternatives out there. Try these series: Chet Gecko Mysteries, Magic Tree House, Secrets of Droon, Animal Ark Series, A to Z Mysteries, Box Car Children, American Girl History Mysteries and the 3 Adventure series - Island, Dive, and Everest. Also books by Eva Ibbotson, Beverly Cleary, Judy Blume, George Selden, E.B. White, R. Dahl, Estes and Eager.
Example: [One of the best I have ever read!!!] Yoga for the New Millenniuma novel by Tamal Krishna GoswamiYoga for the New Millennium easily disposes of questions pondered by mankind for thousands of years. Travel with a young man on his journey of self - discovery and see how the timeless truths of the ancient yoga system are powerfully relevant today, at a time when humanity is seeking solutions to unprecedented problems.His Holiness Tamal Krishna Goswami is a world - renowned teacher and practitioner of yoga as presented in the ancient Vedas of India, such as The Bhagavad - gita. He has lectured internationally for over 30 years and his books have been translated into several languages.This soft bound book is 195 pages long. I personally couldn't put it down and feel that is is one of the most interesting and well written novels I have ever read. Fascinating, and intelligently done, I HIGHLY recommend this great book! Get it today!!
Example: [John's Recommendation] The Train is a very good movie that takes place during WW2. It portrays the Nazi's efforts to steal and ship the Art of France to Berlin by rail and how the French underground put a stop to it. A very good Movie.
Example: [Good book group material] I came upon this book inadvertently during some surfing on Amazon. I was intrigued by the reviews & ordered it. It is a wonderfully complex story that everyone in my book group praised. The author vividly presents the lives of the sandhoggers and masterfully interweaves the present day with the past.
Example: [Still the best energy modelling book] Good balance of intuition and technical details on modelling and pricing energy related derivatives. Very hands on discussion on the pros and cons of various approaches. Ideal for quants or quantitative traders with a good understanding of stochastic calculus and statistics.
Example: [Does not come with two extra wheels as it says it would] The product features says that the board comes with "Value Pack includes two extra wheels" however it does not.Product FeaturesGroundbreaking caster board that acts like a skateboard/snowboard hybridPivoting deck and 360-degree caster trucks enable snowboard-like carvingSpiked traction pads, kick tail and nose, and concave deck design76mm polyurethane wheels and precision ABEC-5 bearing casters; Value Pack includes two extra wheelsDesigned for riders age 8 years and up; supports up to 220 pounds
Example: [Fun...just fun to watch] This is a really creative idea--to make a period piece following the classic Lovecraft tale using the same film style that was present when the story was written. Just a brilliant move. I really like that this was made by members of the HP Lovecraft Historical Society as well. If you are a Lovecraft fan, and would like to see a film stylized to fit 1930's style of silent picture, get it. The art-deco Cthulu statue is a nice touch as well.
Example: [Fast and tight action story] Tight story telling and nerve breaking suspenseful action drama with solid performances!!One can see why Korean made movies are so popular in all over the Asian regions these days!!!
Example: [Battery dead in 5 months] Bought these for our sports team on December 6. Five months later the batteries are dead even though it is advertised with a 1.5 year battery life. Looks like they were manufactured in 2009. There is no tab to pull out to start the battery running the watch so it is running before you receive it. They take an LR43 Maxell battery and you have to remove 5 tiny screws to change the battery. I wouldn't buy it again. It does work properly, though, until it dies.
Example: [Not what was promised] I do not buy Library Discards.This book was supposed to be "like new" (even the sticker on the back cover says so) and said nothing about a library discard.The book is in poor cover condition, the pages are very yellow and it is most definitely a library discard.I will not be able to use it in our library so this was a total waste of money!I will not be purchasing from this seller again.
Example: [A great piece of history and musical history] One night I was going through my music of the 40's and re-discovered Jane Froman singing WITH A SONG IN MY HEART. After shedding my goosebumps I remembered that it came from an Academy Award movie in my young days. I did an online search and up it came. I didn't even dream it was still available. But Amazon had it. I ordered it because my very musical granddaughter has grown to love movie music and broadway. I would love to hear her sing this song. And what a great way for a young person to piece together some WWII history and showbiz history and radio history at the same time.Thank you Jane for your music and your commitment to the USA. Thank you Amazon for having it.Dick Pickensretired dj
Example: [perfect] I can't use a blade on my face, it irritates my skin. I've tried a lot of electric trimmers. this one by far is the closest shave I have ever had with an electric. it's tiny. it's not unreasonably loud like some other reviews say, it's an electric trimmer, they make noise, big deal. I only write reviews if something is awesome or awful. these trimmers are awesome. if it ever breaks, I'm buying the same one again.
Example: [BRING IT BACK ON DVD!] My sister and I used to watch this movie among all others when we were little. Not only did we love the Lyle Lyle Crocodile books, but when a friend of the family sent us a homemade copy on VHS of this animated version of The House on East 88th St, it quickly became a new favorite. Fortunately, I still have that tape in my attic, but my VCR has been in the landfill for years, since it's kaput. I want it not only for myself, but I have a friend who just had a kid, and they too will need a copy of this first-rate cartoon musical. PLEASE BRING IT BACK!
Example: [Pretty good workout!] I consider myself to be in good shape and I workout by either running 5 miles or DVD's such as Insanity/Bob Harper/Jillian Michael's 5-6 days a week. This DVD is fun and not as hard as those mentioned but works up a good sweat and I love how it is broken up into 10 min segments. I am definitely interested in trying more 10 min Solution DVD's to add to my rotation!
Example: [Good enough to please !] Finished this book in a day. OK it is not classic but it is fun read, with a plot exciting enough to keep me flipping the pages. I know this is fiction but Brown should have tried harder to get his facts right. I am an admirer of the great genius, Michelangelo and Brown has definitely erred in his reference to this great artist's works. First Michelangelo was not the architect of any stair case in the Vatican City. Second the Vatican does not possess any male nude sculpture by Michelangelo, with its stony penis removed . Dan's errors is irritating and a trifle irresposible. Still Angels & Demons is great entertainment and will not be my last book by this writer.
Example: [Did not last long] I had this unit for a little over one year. The refrigerant coil started leaking just after the warranty ran out. Had to junk it. Would not recommend.
Example: [Great tool] Excellent tool for learning the techniques and licks of this album, author should do a few other. Highly recommended.
